Arbitrage mutual funds offer an investment route that exploits arbitrage opportunities and mitigates risk, making them an alternative to traditional investment options like bank FDs. They are a type of investment activity that generates returns by focusing on the value in both future and cash markets. Arbitrage mutual funds are supported by various financial institutions and can help investors achieve their financial goals. They are exemplified by various funds such as SBI Arbitrage Opportunities Fund, Baroda BNP Paribas Arbitrage Fund, and others, making them a popular choice among investors.'"
