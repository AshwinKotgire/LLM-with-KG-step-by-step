\\nGlobally, alternative investment industry evolved over time, hence there is no uniform \\nclassification or limitation to what constitutes such assets. Alternative investments are \\ntherefore defined generally by several sources as investments other than traditional \\ninvestments. 2  Traditional investments (as distinguished from savings in bank deposits, \\ngovernment schemes, ornamental gold and residential property for living purposes) are \\nconfined to the domain of financial securities such as stocks and bonds from primary and \\nsecondary capital market, purchase of general categories of mutual fund units and Exchange \\nTraded Funds (ETFs). Traditional investments cater to general investors who seek investment \\noptions which provide better returns than mere savings schemes.  \\n \\nAlternative investments evolved over time to cater to the requirements of sophisticated \\ninvestors such as institutional investors managing pools of funds and High net-worth \\nindividual investors (HNIs) who have higher risk-taking capability and need more \\nsophisticated avenues than traditional investment options. Unlike traditional investments, \\nalternative investments are about investing in opportunities that can potentially generate \\nhigher returns but entail higher risk-taking as well. Alternative investments are meant to \\ncomplement traditional investments for such investors by improving their risk-adjusted \\nreturns over the long term (see Table 1.1). \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n2According to Investopedia, “An alternative investment is a financial asset that does not fall into one of the \\nconventional investment categories. Conventional categories include stocks, bonds, and cash.” \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES: \\nAfter studying this chapter, you should know about: \\n• \\nDifference between Traditional investments and Alternative investments \\n• \\nDifferent avenues of alternative investments such as venture capital, private \\nequity, real estate etc. \\n• \\nGlobal evolution and growth of alternative investments \\n• \\nRole of alternative investment funds in portfolio management \\n14 | P a g e  \\n \\nTable 1.1: Traditional and Alternative Investments – a comparative Listing \\nTraditional \\nAlternative \\nDual \\nPublic equities – listed \\nstock \\nPrivate equity – direct \\ninvestments in unlisted \\nstock (privately held \\ncompanies) \\nClosed ended debt funds \\nwith illiquid assets such as \\nreal estate exposures \\nListed debt securities \\nissued by both listed and \\nunlisted companies \\nDirect investment in \\nunlisted (rated or unrated) \\ndebt securities or loan \\ncapital \\nExchange traded stable and \\npredictable cash flow \\ninstruments such as \\nSecurity Receipts issued by \\nsecuritisation companies, \\nSpecial Purpose Vehicles \\n(SPVs), Asset \\nReconstruction Companies \\n(ARCs) \\nOpen ended mutual funds \\noffering equity, debt or \\nbalanced exposures to \\nlisted debt, money market \\ninstruments and listed \\nequity \\nDirect investments in real \\nestate and infrastructure \\ndeveloper Project SPVs \\n \\nUnits issued by Real Estate \\nInvestments Trusts (REITs) \\nand Infrastructure \\nInvestment Trusts (INVITs) \\noffering stable cash flow \\nand rating \\nExchange traded simple \\nderivative instruments \\nsuch as futures & options \\nused to manage portfolio \\nrisk on equities \\nDirect investment in \\ncommodities \\nMutual funds with \\nalternative or contrarian \\nstrategies that entail higher \\nrisk taking    \\nExchange traded funds \\n(ETFs) \\nHedge Funds \\nComplex structured \\nproducts and derivatives \\nsuch as Collateralised Debt \\nObligations (CDOs), Over-\\nthe-counter derivatives \\nDistressed Asset Funds \\nthat finance or acquire \\n \\n15 | P a g e  \\n \\nTraditional \\nAlternative \\nDual \\ncompanies in financial \\ndistress and Funds that \\ninvest in Special Situations \\nsuch as Mergers & \\nAcquisitions / hostile \\nacquisitions / \\nrestructuring. These are \\ncomplex corporate \\ntransactions where one \\ncompany takes ownership \\ncontrol of another \\ncompany or goes through \\na reorganisation of its \\nassets and liabilities due to \\nfinancial difficulties. \\n \\nAs may be observed from Table 1.1, traditional investments are primarily on-market \\nopportunities3 that whose common feature is liquidity, i.e. nearness to cash because they can \\nbe exited through the market or by anytime redemption offered by an open ended mutual \\nfund. The essential characteristic of alternative investments is ‘illiquidity’, i.e. they are not \\nreadily convertible into cash as they are either off-market investments or because they are \\ncomplex structures that do not have a ready market. The dual class could include structures \\nthat have underlying illiquid assets but the instruments per se may be liquid as they are either \\nlisted on the stock exchange or are redeemable through the mutual fund route with some \\nrestrictions.  \\n \\n1.1.1 Definition of Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) \\n \\nThe SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations 2012 (AIF Regulations) that currently \\nregulate such activity define the term ‘Alternative Investment Fund’ (AIF) as one which is \\nprimarily a privately pooled investment vehicle. However, since there are several types of \\ninvestment funds in the market, the definition prescribes that only a ‘privately pooled’ \\n                                                          \\n \\n3As mentioned earlier, traditional investments are primarily meant to provide high liquidity to investors through \\nthe capital market trading mechanism. Therefore, listed shares and bonds, units of mutual funds and exchange \\ntraded funds fit this requirement very well. \\n16 | P a g e  \\n \\nstructure with funds pooled from India or abroad for a defined investment policy is to be \\nconsidered as an AIF. The words ‘privately pooled’ denote that the fund is pooled from select \\ninvestors and not from the general public at large. These private investors are sourced from \\ncategories such as institutions and HNIs who can understand the nuances of higher risk taking \\nand complex investment arrangements. Nonetheless, the following categories are explicitly \\nexcluded from this definition – \\n▪ Any fund which is a mutual fund or a collective investment scheme as per SEBI \\nregulations. \\n▪ Family trusts, ESOP or other such employee benefit trusts, holding companies, SPVs \\nset up for securitisation or other such purposes. \\n▪ Funds set up under RBI regulations such as securitisation companies or under the \\npurview of any other regulator. \\n \\nIt may be noted that the exclusions are either private funds of a company, business or a family \\nor those that are regulated by other regulators such as RBI or IRDAI. \\n \\n1.1.2 Investors in AIF \\n \\nInternationally, the investors in an AIF are primarily large institutional funds such as pension \\nfunds, investment funds, insurance companies, endowment funds, investment banks, family \\noffices and HNIs, fund of funds and AIF managers themselves. All these investors have large \\npools of funds managed by fund managers who would be seeking varied investment options \\nbeyond traditional investments. AIFs cater to the needs of such investors through alternative \\nasset classes.  \\n \\n1.2 Alternative Investment Avenues \\n \\nThere are several avenues for creating alternative assets such as venture capital, private \\nequity, hedge funds, Over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange traded derivative contracts, real \\nestate, commodities, precious metals, arts and antiques. These are briefly explained below. \\n \\n1.2.1 Venture Capital \\n \\nVenture capital (VC) investing is about direct investment in infant companies with businesses \\nthat are yet to grow or evolve completely. These businesses are also known as ‘start-ups or \\n‘early stage’ businesses. AIF Regulations state that these are concerned with new products, \\n17 | P a g e  \\n \\nnew services, technology or intellectual property-based activities or a new business model. \\nThese nascent ventures show high promise to grow into large businesses or start to \\ndemonstrate growth at a very high growth rate year on year. Since these businesses are small, \\nthey are susceptible to high mortality rate. Assessing their future potential is also a difficult \\nand complex task. Venture capital investments are therefore considered highly risky and rank \\nas such among alternative investments. The rationale of VC investments is to make higher \\nreturns based early investment in the business growth potential.  \\n \\nIn order to give impetus to start-up financing in India, the Government of India under the \\nDepartment for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) defines a start-up as a \\nbusiness that is not more than 10 years old and has not recorded a turnover of more than INR \\n100 crore in any financial year. Such companies have to be engaged in innovation, \\ndevelopment or improvement of products, or a scalable business model with a high potential \\nof employment/ wealth generation. \\n \\n1.2.2 Private Equity \\n \\nThe term ‘private equity’ (PE) has wider import and is a generic term used for direct \\ninvestments in companies that are not listed on a stock exchange. In other words, it is equity \\ncapital raised by companies from external investors without accessing public equity markets. \\nTherefore, venture capital is a type of private equity used for early stage businesses. But the \\nterm ‘private equity’ is predominantly used to denote investment in companies with \\nestablished business model and track record (known as ‘later stage’ companies). Private \\nequity also participates in more complex transactions involving control acquisitions (known \\nas ‘buyout’) and Leveraged Buy Outs (LBOs) which comprise of doing buyouts with significant \\nleverage. In such transactions, investors typically look to acquire controlling interests of either \\n51% or more of the share capital or voting rights of a target company. Conventionally, pure \\nplay private equity model revolves around providing growth capital to later stage unlisted \\ncompanies by subscribing to their equity capital. The rationale of PE investment is to achieve \\nhigher than market returns by investing in promising and growing unlisted companies and \\nexiting at higher valuations in future based on their future performance. \\n \\nThe word ‘equity’ has a wider import in private equity parlance. In normal terms, it refers to \\nequity share capital only. In the context of private equity, it refers to the total capital raised \\nfrom private investors even though the instrument used may not always be an equity share. \\nThis is because both venture capital and private equity investments have evolved over time \\nto address various business situations faced by young and growing companies. Similarly, \\n18 | P a g e  \\n \\nbased on the evolution of alternative asset classes, private equity has also extended to \\nproviding debt capital through ‘private debt’. Therefore, the term ‘private equity’ refers to \\ncapital raised from private investors which can be equity, preference, debt or mezzanine \\ncapital depending upon the structures used in specific transactions. Mezzanine capital refers \\nto funds that are provided in a hybrid structure involving the features of both debt and equity \\ncapital. Accordingly, while most funds look at equity as the main instrument to provide \\ncapital, pure ‘private debt funds’ and hybrid funds are also prevalent in the industry. The SEBI \\n(AIF) Regulations differentiate between private equity funds and pure debt funds. Therefore, \\nthese are explained as per the given classification in Unit 3. \\n \\n1.2.3 Hedge Funds \\n \\nHedge Funds are pooled investment vehicles, which make investments in financial assets, \\ncomplex derivative contracts and currencies. The factors that differentiate hedge funds from \\nother AIFs are: \\n(a) The objectives of Hedge Funds allow them to invest across different classes of \\nassets (i.e. financial assets, currencies, complex derivatives),  \\n(b) Hedge Funds use complex investment strategies (such as arbitrage, carry trade \\netc.) for variable outcomes and complex risk patterns and  \\n(c) Hedge Funds take both long and short positions and use significant leverage at fund \\nlevel.4 \\nThis breadth of investment platform given to hedge funds is what makes them speculative \\nand highly susceptible to capital at risk. It is the ability of these funds to go both long and \\nshort in various markets that has given them the name ‘hedge funds’. SEBI defines a hedge \\nfund as an “Alternative Investment Fund which employs diverse or complex trading strategies \\nand invests and trades in securities having diverse risks or complex products including listed \\nand unlisted derivatives”. \\n \\n1.2.4 Real Estate and Infrastructure \\n \\nAlternative investment is also related to the real estate sector where investment can be made \\ninto property development companies or specific projects. While general investors acquire \\n                                                          \\n \\n4 ‘Leveraging at fund level’ means that the fund entity will borrow from market sources to make investments as \\na part of its investment activity. The idea is to generate arbitrage return for the fund by using debt (which costs \\nlesser) to make investment gains (which are meant to be higher). However, this strategy also increases overall \\ninvestment risk as the fund is obligated to pay back the debt irrespective of investment gains or losses. \\nTherefore, hedge funds are characteristic of higher risk taking as compared to other AIFs that do not leverage at \\nfund level. \\n19 | P a g e  \\n \\npersonal properties either for occupation or as long-term investment, alternative investors \\nlook for more sophisticated and risky investment avenues. These include investment in real \\nestate funds that finance big ticket projects. Such investments entail considerable market risk \\nassociated with the sector or illiquidity risk due to long gestation period. Some of these are \\nalso structured as real estate PE funds that provide growth capital to companies engaged in \\nthe real estate sector or project specific SPVs. A recent addition to the real estate portfolio is \\nREITs that offer the advantage of investing in the sector without physically holding real estate \\nassets. REITs are securities that entitle the holders to underlying cash flow generated from \\nrent yielding properties. Since REITs are liquid due to their listed status, they are sometimes \\nconsidered either traditional assets or in the dual category. \\n \\nSimilar securities issued by entities managing large infrastructure assets with long term \\ncontracts that ensure steady and periodic returns (with predictable and lower level of risk \\ntaking on their cash flow) are known as Infrastructure Investment Trusts units (InvIT units). \\nThese are preferred by low risk-taking long-term investors such as pension funds and \\ninsurance companies. InvITs are also listed and tradable on the capital market making them \\nakin to traditional assets. \\n \\n1.2.5 Commodities \\n \\nCommodities such as metals (both precious and non-precious) are used as underlying assets \\nfor alternative investment. Just as gold and other precious metals, gems and jewellery are \\nused as hedge against inflation; commodities often serve the same purpose. Though soft \\ncommodities such as agricultural produce including cash crops such as cotton, coffee etc. are \\nmore common in trade and speculation, alternative investors usually look for opportunities \\nin hard commodities such as oil & gas and metals (such as copper, aluminium and precious \\nmetals).    \\n \\n1.2.6 Others \\n \\nApart from the above, alternative investment asset classes include gems and precious stones, \\narts and antiques, film funds, sports, vintage wines, stamps and collectibles. India is \\nwitnessing unprecedented growth in the FinTech platforms, which offer returns to investors \\non the platform in the form of interest, rental yields or equity shares of start-ups and unlisted \\ncompanies. \\n \\n20 | P a g e  \\n \\n1.3 Alternative Investments – Antecedents and Growth \\n \\nAfter the Industrial Revolution of 18th century, the size and scale of business operations \\n(mostly manufacturing) required large financing and corporatisation. Though bank financing \\nwas the mainstay for business finance, venture capital made a beginning as a risk financing \\nmodel in situations which banks perceived as risky or unworkable. Venture capital at this \\nstage was not institutionalised but mostly confined to wealthy individuals. The early merchant \\nbanks of UK became the first institutional financiers which later spread to other parts of \\nEurope and USA.  \\n \\nIn parallel, there was also a steady growth and organisation of investment fund pools centred \\non bank treasuries, endowment funds, pension funds and insurance companies. In the early \\ndays of investing, the traditional approach advocated safety over diversity due to which till \\nthe 1920s, institutional investors invested in government securities, mortgages and \\npreference capital. Slowly institutional investing became professionalised to meet the \\nrequirement to manage such large pools of investable funds. Around the 1940-50s, US \\nwitnessed its first batch of institutional venture funds run by professional venture capitalists \\nthat identified venture capital as the early stage risk capital for small businesses. Beginning \\nwith the 1950s and 1960s, modern portfolio theory made considerable advances which \\nestablished the mechanics and advantages of diversification advocating the principle that risk \\nfrom alternative investments can be diversified. The fund management industry grew \\nenormously in the 1970s and 80s as well. While diversification of business risk was evident in \\ncorporate strategy, investment strategy for institutions began to be increasingly evaluated on \\na portfolio basis. \\n \\nPortfolio assessment of investment risks revolutionised the basket of assets available for \\ninvestment. Several investment options hitherto considered risky assets such as small cap and \\nunlisted stocks, low quality listed and unlisted corporate bonds, high-yield debt, structured \\nproducts and other alternate asset classes became common among institutional investors as \\na part of portfolio risk diversification strategy to maximise returns better than from traditional \\nassets. Evaluated on a standalone basis, many of these alternative assets had insufficiently \\nreliable income and were even subject to the risk of capital loss as well in some cases. But \\nwhen held in a portfolio, these relatively high-risk investments could lower the total risk of \\nthe portfolio because of their ability to provide improved diversification.    \\n \\nIn the US, the VC industry got further boost when the Small Business Investment Act was \\npassed in 1958 which provided recognition and tax breaks for small business investment \\ncompanies and regulation through the Small Business Administration. The Act also enabled \\n21 | P a g e  \\n \\nbanks to invest in such VC companies which then witnessed explosive growth. During the \\nlatter part of the twentieth century, the VC model refined itself and positioned itself as risk \\ncapital to early stage technology companies. \\n \\nIn the 1980s, the flow of funds into this industry was enormous with more types of investors \\ngetting into financing young unlisted business companies. The main trigger was of course the \\nstrong primary market for IPOs. Investors felt that nurturing good IPO candidates was a sure \\nformula to profitable exits. This led to the explosion in both venture capital and later stage \\nprivate equity financing funds. However, the industry had its share of setbacks during the late \\n1980s. The explosive growth of the industry meant shortage of good deals and expertise of \\nprofessional private equity specialists. The industry suffered again during the dotcom bust in \\n2001 due to astronomical valuations and euphoria surrounding internet businesses. However, \\nthe industry gathered its feet again and both venture capital and later stage private equity hit \\nthe high growth curve after 2004. The stage was also set for larger PE funds to enter the \\ncontrol acquisitions (buyout) market which is presently a large segment of the global private \\nequity and M&A market.  \\n \\nIn the post-2008 scenario, alternative investments went through a big leap as market \\nopportunities in traditional investments became more difficult to satisfy investor \\nrequirements for differentiated returns. According to the Bain Private Equity Report, the \\nperiod since 2014 was that of unprecedented success for the private equity industry.5 During \\nthat span, more money was raised, invested and distributed back to investors than in any \\nother period in the industry’s history. Alternative debt funds also grew substantially creating \\nmarkets once again for high-yield debt and structured products such as real estate investment \\ntrusts and infrastructure investment trusts. Figure 1.1 shows the three-fold jump in \\nalternative assets post-2008. \\n \\nFigure 1.1: Alternative Assets \\n                                                          \\n \\n5 Global Private Equity Report 2019, Bain & Company \\n22 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\n \\n1.4 Role of Alternative Investments in Portfolio Management \\n \\nPortfolio management needs to be ever-evolving to meet improved return expectations of \\ninvestors. However, this is easier said than done. In the 21st century new challenges have been \\nemerging to generate business returns from established business models due to technological \\ninnovations, environmental concerns, regulatory challenges, economic volatility in several \\neconomies, geo-political issues and changing needs of markets and customers. Due to \\neconomic slowdown in developed economies, central banks of the world have been using \\nexpansionary monetary policy and even zero or negative benchmark rates to revive their \\neconomies. This has caused fall in investment returns in developed markets and a shift to \\nemerging markets in the past two decades.  \\n \\nWhile there are new opportunities to be explored in the developed markets, emerging \\nmarkets are the hot bed of growth and innovation especially in the emerging sectors of \\nbusiness. In order that investors generate superior returns, it is necessary to look beyond \\ntraditional investments. Institutional fund managers are aware of the need for new avenues \\nto diversification of their portfolios. There are huge opportunities in handholding new \\nventures in sunrise industries and technologies as also in structured products emerging from \\nthe markets. Asset allocators in institutional investment classes should not miss out on \\nimproved diversification and stellar early or first-mover returns (i.e., high returns resulting \\nfrom investing early into new asset classes).  \\n \\nThe rationale for alternative investments is not just about returns. Investors are looking at \\nalternative investments for other reasons as well. Figure 1.2 represents the position. \\nUSD 13.7 trillion in AUM across all alternative asset managers globally (as of December 2021) \\n23 | P a g e  \\n \\nFigure 1.26 \\n \\nIn the above exhibit, the nature of each type of AIF with regard to the given set of factors is \\nexplained. For e.g. private equity funds score better on the criteria of ‘High Absolute Returns’ \\nand ‘Diversification’ but score poorly on ‘Reliable Income Stream’. This is because, they invest \\nin growth companies that usually provide good exit returns but do not declare significant \\ndividends. Similarly, infrastructure funds compare well on the parameters of ‘Reliable Income \\nStreams’ as they predominantly invest in InvITS and operational projects that provide steady \\nincome streams. However, infrastructure projects rate poorly in terms of risk-adjusted \\nreturns. \\n \\nThe following Table 1.2 captures the strengths and limitations of alternative investments.  \\n \\nTable1.2: Comparative Assessment of Alternative Investments \\n \\nBENEFITS \\nLIMITATIONS \\nHelps in risk diversification by moving \\nbeyond traditional investment avenues. \\nComplex fund structuring is required which \\nmakes it difficult for investors to \\ncomprehend. \\nProvides better risk-return trade-off by \\nactively investing in high-growth \\nopportunities and monitoring them. \\nComplex contractual terms and tedious \\ndocumentations make it necessary for \\ninvestors to constantly seek professional \\nsupport. \\n                                                          \\n \\n6Source: www.preqin.com [Extract from a presentation by Preqin dated July 7, 2019] \\n \\n24 | P a g e  \\n \\nBENEFITS \\nLIMITATIONS \\nAlpha return generation due to off-market \\ninvestment strategies. \\nLess transparency as compared to \\ntraditional investments. Difficulty in \\nassessment of underlying risks. \\nProvides growth capital to businesses and \\ncompanies that may not be able to attract \\nconventional sources of capital such as \\nbank financing. \\nMore complex return determination \\nmethodologies as compared to traditional \\ninvestments. \\nProvides the services of fund managers \\nwho are experienced in generating \\ncustomised investment opportunities to \\nmaximise returns. \\nIlliquidity is one of the main disadvantages \\nas many of the investment opportunities \\nhave a long investment cycle.  \\nSometimes, there is scope for \\ncustomisation in investment terms in a \\nlimited way as compared to a standardised \\ninvestment template for all investors in a \\ngiven fund or scheme. \\nDo not satisfy the requirement for regular \\nincome.  \\n \\nThe challenge for an asset allocator in the 21st century is to consider alternative investments \\nacross markets and asset classes and to decide, as skilfully as possible, which new types of \\nassets to include in a portfolio and which to exclude. Without the inclusion of alternative \\ninvestments, portfolio management cannot meet the challenge of generating consistent \\nsuperior returns or the ‘alpha’ when economic challenges are limiting the returns from \\ntraditional investments. At the same time, asset managers have to be mindful of the \\nlimitations and risks of alternative investments in terms of untried sectors or technology, \\nbusiness risks, illiquidity risk, market risks, entrepreneurial limitations, contractual risks and \\neconomic factors that could limit the alpha generation from such investments. Both empirical \\nanalysis and economic reasoning have to be considered equally in making such portfolio \\ndiversification choices.   \\n \\nHowever, there are challenges ahead. High valuations in emerging markets, volatile capital \\nmarkets across the world, anti-globalisation trends, geo-political risks emerging from trade \\nwars and other factors, interest rate changes by central banks and of course, the increasing \\ncall from global economists about the next recession have dampened investor sentiment and \\nincreased uncertainty risk. The pace of technological change has become too fast to grasp and \\n25 | P a g e  \\n \\ndisruption trends are making it harder to forecast winners and losers in almost every industry, \\nwhether existing or emerging. \\n \\n \\n26 | P a g e  \\n \\nChapter 1: Sample Questions \\n \\n1.

Jones & Co. launched the first hedge fund. “Hedge Funds” were described as \\nany investment fund that used incentive fees, short selling, and leverage to maximize returns \\nfor the investors. Over time, hedge funds began to diversify their investment portfolios to \\ninclude other financial instruments such as fixed income securities, convertible securities, \\ncurrencies, exchange traded futures contracts, commodity futures and commodity options. \\n \\nIndian capital markets witnessed significant growth in the 1990s. With the notification of rules \\nand regulations governing Portfolio Managers and SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, the asset \\nmanagement business took shape in the private sector in India.  \\n \\nForeign Investors were investing significant funds through Hedge funds and Funds-of-Funds, \\nset-up in offshore jurisdictions. Such funds invested directly in Indian Securities Market, or \\nthrough Offshore Derivative Instruments (ODIs), issued by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) \\nagainst underlying Indian securities. As at end of March 2004, the hedge funds accounted for \\nabout 5 percent of the market value of the total assets held by the FIIs in India. \\n \\nEurekahedge India Long Short Equities Hedge Fund Index is an equally weighted index of 15 \\nconstituent funds. The index was designed to provide a broad measure of the performance \\nof underlying hedge fund managers who invest exclusively in India. The index is base weighted \\nat 100, as on December 1999. As seen from Figure 2.1, the India-focused hedge funds have \\n28 | P a g e  \\n \\nshown consistent returns, even after a decrease in the index value during the Global Financial \\nCrisis of 2008. \\n \\nFigure 2.1: Historical Performance of Eurekahedge India Long Short Equities Hedge Fund \\nIndex, since inception \\n \\n \\n \\nHowever, no hedge funds were domiciled in India. Offshore hedge funds were not able to \\noffer their products to Indian investors within India as there was no regulatory regime for \\nhedge funds to be set up or marketed in India.  \\n \\n• Any offering of shares to at least 50 persons would constitute a public offering and the \\nfund would be required to issue and register a prospectus for the same.  \\n• As per RBI Circular No. 80 dated March 18 2004, any Indian Bank appointed by \\noffshore funds, to market their products in Indian markets, had to seek prior approval \\nfrom RBI for acting as an agent of such overseas funds. \\n• Some hedge funds were not being regulated by the respective securities regulator(s) \\nin their country of incorporation, due to which they were prohibited to enter the \\nIndian Securities Market as an FII, as per the erstwhile SEBI (Foreign Institutional \\nInvestors) Regulations. However, Hedge Funds could invest through a ‘sub-account’, \\nif sponsored by a registered Foreign Institutional Investor and meeting the \\nrequirements of ‘fit and proper’ persons. \\n \\nFurthermore, on account of the absence of full capital account convertibility, the general \\nprinciples of corporate law and exchange control laws were applicable to such funds. As a \\nresult, Indian residents were not permitted to invest in foreign securities, except in \\n29 | P a g e  \\n \\naccordance with the regulations framed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, \\nor as prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India, from time to time. \\n \\nConsidering the above-mentioned restrictions, hedge funds had limited options for marketing \\ntheir products to Indian investors, as mentioned under: \\n \\nIndian Resident Individuals:  \\n \\n• On February 4, 2004, RBI introduced a Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) which \\npermitted Indian resident individuals to invest up to USD 25,000 per year for any \\npurpose including investment in foreign securities.7 Subsequently, this ceiling was \\nincreased up to USD 250,000 per individual, per financial year, in June 20158 However, \\nforeign hedge funds had minimum investment limits as high as USD 100,000 per \\ninvestor, hence limiting the capital inflows from Indian investors in India. \\n \\n• Alternatively, Indian resident individuals were permitted to acquire foreign securities \\nif the consideration for such foreign securities was paid out of a Resident Foreign \\nCurrency (RFC) account. \\n \\nIndian Mutual Funds: \\n \\nIndian mutual funds could invest only up to 10 percent of its net assets in foreign securities. \\nHence, a limited number of qualified mutual funds were allowed to invest in overseas \\nexchange traded funds.  \\n \\nIndian Listed Companies: \\n \\nIndian listed companies were permitted to invest in foreign companies listed on a recognised \\nstock exchange. \\n \\nIdentification of Hedge Funds: Up to 2012 \\n \\nAn approach for identifying hedge funds, as suggested by International Organization of \\nSecurities Commission (IOSCO) was to look at the characteristics of fund management \\n                                                          \\n \\n7RBI Circular No.: RBI/2004/39 dated February 4, 2004 on Liberalised Remittance Scheme of USD 25,000 for \\nResident Individuals. \\n8 RBI Circular No.: RBI/2013-14/620 A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No.106 dated June 1, 2015 on Liberalised \\nRemittance Scheme for Resident Individuals- Enhancement of limit. \\n30 | P a g e  \\n \\nstrategies employed by such funds. In order to be recognized as Hedge funds, they would \\nneed to at least exhibit some of the following characteristics:  \\ni. \\nNon-applicability of borrowing and leverage restrictions. \\nii. \\nSignificant performance fees are paid to the investment manager, in addition to an \\nannual management fees.  \\niii. \\nInvestors are typically permitted to redeem their interests periodically, i.e. quarterly, \\nsemi-annually or annually. \\niv. \\nInvestment of significant ‘own’ funds by the investment manager. \\nv. \\nUse of derivatives, often for speculative purposes, with the ability to short sell \\nsecurities. \\nvi. \\nMore diverse risks or complex underlying products are involved.  \\n \\nRegistration of Hedge Funds as Foreign Institutional Investors: Up to 2012 \\n \\nIn 2004, SEBI was providing a limited window to Hedge Funds, to seek registration within the \\nexisting framework of the SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations as an FII, with the \\nfollowing additional provisions to control and monitor the inherent risks within Hedge Funds: \\n \\ni. \\nThe investment adviser to the hedge fund had to be a regulated investment advisor \\nunder the relevant Investor Advisor Act or the fund had to be registered under \\nInvestment Companies Act.   \\nii. \\nAt least 20 percent of the corpus of the fund had to be contributed by institutional \\ninvestors such as pension funds, university funds, charitable trusts or societies, \\nendowments, banks and insurance companies.  \\niii. \\nThe fund manager or investment adviser was required to have a minimum experience \\nof at least 3 years of managing funds, with similar investment strategy that the \\napplicant fund has adopted. \\n \\nTrends post 2012: \\n \\nThe Hedge Fund industry was at a nascent stage until 2012, post which SEBI introduced the \\nSEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations on May 21, 2012. These Regulations \\nidentified Hedge Funds under “Category III AIF” which follows diverse and complex \\ninvestment strategies, akin to investment strategies followed by Hedge Funds, globally. The \\nperiod between 2012 and 2019 can be termed as the consolidation and transformation phase \\nfor the Category III AIF industry in India, which witnessed a plethora of government reforms \\nand market developments, as discussed below: \\n31 | P a g e  \\n \\n• The AIF industry caught the fancy of the ultra-rich billionaires of India who numbered \\n169 in Forbes list of World’s Billionaires in April 2023. During this phase, several new \\nfund houses and investment managers set up or launched new Category III AIFs, to \\ncater to the wealthy Indian investor community. \\n• As per Notification No. FEMA 355/2015-RB dated November 16, 2015, the Reserve \\nBank of India liberalised the investment restrictions on Persons Resident outside India \\nincluding Registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (RFPI) or Non-resident Indians (NRIs) \\nto invest in AIFs. Investments made by AIFs in India, are considered as foreign \\ninvestment, if neither the Sponsor nor the Manager is Indian ‘owned and controlled’. \\nThe notification further stated that a Category III AIF with foreign investment shall \\nmake portfolio investment in such securities and instruments in which RFPIs are \\nallowed to invest. \\n• Important recommendations were made by the SEBI Alternative Investment Policy \\nAdvisory Committee (AIPAC), headed by Shri Narayan Murthy, in order to improve the \\ntax regime for Category III AIFs as well as boost the inflow of capital from domestic \\ninstitutional investors such as Banks, Insurance Companies, Pension Funds, Charitable \\nOrganizations, Family Offices and High Net worth Individuals. \\n• Rationalization of Total Expense Ratio (TER) charged by equity-oriented Mutual Fund \\nschemes, as per amendments made to SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, have \\nencouraged mutual fund managers to launch Category III AIFs in India and make \\ninvestments, with greater flexibility. As per the structure of Category III AIFs, \\nManagers of AIFs are flexible to charge Performance-based Fees, on the ‘Additional \\nReturn’ earned by the fund above the ‘Reference Hurdle Rate. This fee is paid in \\naddition to the Management Fees charged at a fixed rate by the Manager, on a yearly \\nbasis. However, mutual fund managers are only permitted to charge ‘Management \\nFees’, over and above the ‘Administrative Costs’ and other expenses borne by the \\nfund. \\n• All Category III AIFs registered with SEBI are monitored as per the Operational \\nGuidelines and Risk Management Framework, including the prudential norms and \\nleverage limits specified from time to time. \\n• Investors in Category III AIFs are kept well-informed on a monthly-basis as well as \\nquarterly-basis, with respect to important aspects of the fund such as total funds \\nraised, total investment exposure, concentration limits and leverage taken. \\n• The domestic Category III AIF market grew by identifying new alternative investment \\nopportunities, such as taking exposures in exchange-traded Commodity Futures and \\nCommodity Options contracts. \\n• Category III AIFs making investments in listed mid-cap and small-cap securities and \\nimplementing hedging strategies, through stock-based and index-based futures and \\n32 | P a g e  \\n \\noptions contracts, have emerged. Some of the funds also focus on special situations \\nsuch as merger arbitrage, buybacks, de-listings, open offers, rights offers and \\nconvertible arbitrage. \\n \\n2.2 Types of AIFs \\n \\nAlternative Investment Funds (AIFs) can be of different types based on their investment \\nstrategy and types of assets under management. Under the SEBI (AIF) Regulations, 2012, a \\nSponsor can register the following types of funds as AIFs: – \\n \\n2.2.1 Venture Capital Fund \\nVenture Capital Fund (VCF) means “an AIF which invests primarily in unlisted securities of \\nstart-ups, emerging or early-stage venture capital undertakings mainly involved in new \\nproducts, new services, technology or intellectual property right based activities or a new \\nbusiness model and shall include an angel fund”.  \\n \\n“Start-up” means a private limited company or a limited liability partnership which fulfils the \\ncriteria for start-up as specified by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal \\nTrade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, vide notification no. \\nG.S.R.127(E) dated February 19, 2019 or such other policy of the Central Government issued \\nin this regard from time to time.9  \\n \\n“Venture capital undertaking” refers to domestic company which is not listed on a recognised \\nstock exchange at the time of making investment. \\n \\nVenture capital can be termed as the first stage of institutional financing in an early-stage \\ncompany or start-up, generally after the angel funds are successfully raised by such company \\nor start-up. It is mostly applicable to asset light businesses that are intensive in technology, \\nintellectual property or digital media applications. \\n \\n2.2.2 Angel Fund \\nAngel Fund means “a sub-category of Venture Capital Fund that raises funds from angel \\ninvestors and invests in accordance with the SEBI (AIF) Regulations”. Angel Investor is any \\nperson who proposes to invest in an angel fund and satisfies one of the following conditions, \\nnamely: \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n9 Inserted by the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2021 w.e.f. May 5, \\n2021 \\n33 | P a g e  \\n \\n(a) an individual investor who has Net Tangible Assets of at least INR 2 crore, excluding value \\nof his principal residence, and who \\ni. \\nhas early stage investment experience (i.e. prior experience in investing in start-\\nup/ emerging/ early-stage ventures), or  \\nii. \\nhas experience as a serial entrepreneur (i.e. a person who has promoted/ co-\\npromoted more than one start-up venture), or  \\niii. \\nis a senior management professional with at least 10 years of experience  \\n \\n(b) a body corporate with a net worth of at least INR 10 crore \\n \\n(c) a registered AIF under SEBI (AIF) Regulations or a venture capital fund registered under \\nthe erstwhile SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations 1996. \\n \\n2.2.3 Private Equity Fund \\nPrivate Equity Fund means “an AIF which invests primarily in equity or equity linked \\ninstruments or partnership interests of investee companies according to the stated objective \\nof the fund”10. It may be understood that private equity fund is primarily an equity-based \\ninvestment fund but unlike venture capital funds which are focussed on early stage \\ninvestments, private equity funds are mostly involved in later stage financing in business \\nentities that have established a business model and need to be scaled up for further growth. \\n \\n2.2.4 Debt Fund \\nDebt Fund means “an AIF which invests primarily in debt securities of listed or unlisted \\ninvestee companies or in securitized debt instruments as per the stated objectives of the \\nFund.”11 \\nMany types of debt that are private are considered to be alternative investments because of \\ntheir illiquidity and often because they are not commonly held by traditional investors. Even \\nlisted companies issue debt securities such as non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and bonds \\nthrough private placement that are not available in the traditional investment route.  \\nSome of the venture financing funds also term themselves as ‘venture debt funds’ since they \\nfinance growth-stage venture capital undertakings through mezzanine financing, i.e. debt \\nfinancing with an equity upside, like warrants attached to the debt.  \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n10Equity linked instruments include instruments convertible into equity shares or share warrants, preference \\nshares, debentures compulsorily or optionally convertible into equity. \\n11Inserted by the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Fourth Amendment) Regulations, 2018 w.e.f. August 13, \\n2021 \\n34 | P a g e  \\n \\nSome private debt funds also use Securitized Debt Instruments as a pooled investment vehicle \\nfor asset financing. The pool of funds raised by issuing Securitized Debt Instruments to \\ninvestors, are used to purchase assets such as cars, trucks, electric vehicles, which are leased \\nto corporate clients and the rental income is passed on to the investors. \\n \\nDistressed debt financing through private debt funds is also catching on in India in the form \\nof refinancing settlements with banks and insolvency resolution schemes under the \\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings. Distressed financing provides capital for \\ncompanies with heavy debt burden to turn around or to help in their acquisition by new \\nowners, through auctions that are conducted under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, \\n2016. Such processes are known as ‘insolvency resolution’.  \\n \\n2.2.5 Infrastructure Fund \\nInfrastructure Fund means “an AIF which invests primarily in unlisted securities or partnership \\ninterest or listed debt or securitised debt instruments of investee companies or special \\npurpose vehicles engaged in or formed for the purpose of operating, developing or holding \\ninfrastructure projects”. Infrastructure debt or equity financing through AIFs is of recent \\nphenomenon in India. Sovereign Wealth Funds, Multi-lateral Funds and Thematic AIFs are the \\nkey investors in this space, due to its high illiquidity, long gestation risk in project \\nimplementation and long amortisation of the debt to infrastructure projects. \\n \\n2.2.6 SME Fund \\nSmall and Medium Enterprise (SME) Fund means “an AIF which invests primarily in unlisted \\nsecurities of investee companies which are SMEs or securities of those SMEs which are listed \\nor proposed to be listed on a SME exchange or SME segment of an exchange”. In this context, \\nSME means a Small and Medium Enterprise and shall have the same meaning as assigned to \\nit under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act 2006, as amended from \\ntime to time. \\n \\n2.2.7 Hedge Fund \\nHedge Fund means “an AIF which employs diverse or complex trading strategies and invests \\nand trades in securities having diverse risks or complex products including listed and unlisted \\nderivatives”. \\n \\n35 | P a g e  \\n \\n2.2.8 Social Impact Fund12 \\nSocial Impact Fund means “an AIF which invests primarily in securities or units or partnership \\ninterest of social ventures or securities of social enterprises and which satisfies the social \\nperformance norms laid down by the fund.”  \\n \\n‘Social Ventures’ are formed with the purpose of promoting social welfare, solving social \\nproblems, or providing social benefits. These may include:  \\n• Public Charitable Trusts registered with the Charity Commissioner \\n• Societies registered for charitable purposes or for promotion of science, literature, or \\nfine arts \\n• Section 8 company, registered as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013  \\n• Micro-finance Institutions \\n \\n2.2.9 Special Situations Fund13 \\nSpecial Situations Fund is “an AIF which invests in special situation assets, in accordance with \\nits investment objectives, and may act as a resolution applicant under the Insolvency and \\nBankruptcy Code, 2016.” \\nSpecial Situation Assets include: \\n• Stressed loans available for acquisition as per Clause 58 of Master Direction - Reserve \\nBank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021 \\n• Stressed loans available for acquisition as part of a Resolution Plan approved under \\nthe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) \\n• Security Receipts issued by an Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC), registered with \\nthe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) \\n• Securities of companies: \\no whose stressed loans are available for acquisition, as mentioned above. \\no against whose borrowings, Security Receipts have been issued by an ARC. \\no whose borrowings are subject to corporate insolvency resolution process \\nunder IBC, with a credit rating of ‘D’ or equivalent.  \\no who have disclosed all defaults relating to payment of interest and principal \\non loans/debt securities issued by the company. In this case, the default should \\nbe continuing for ninety calendar days after declaration of such default, and \\nthe loans/debt securities of the company should have a credit rating of ‘D’ or \\nequivalent. \\n                                                          \\n \\n12 Inserted by SEBI (AIF) (Third Amendment) Regulations, 2022 w.e.f.

Units of a Corporate Debt Market Development Fund are issued to Asset \\nManagement Companies. The purpose of such fund is to purchase corporate debt securities \\nfrom debt-oriented mutual fund schemes during periods of market dislocation. Such debt-\\noriented mutual fund schemes must ensure that: \\n• Corporate Debt securities shall be listed and have an investment grade rating. \\n• Residual maturity of such securities shall not exceed five years on the date of \\npurchase. \\n• Such securities have no material possibility of default or adverse credit news or views. \\nDuring such periods when there is no market dislocation, the fund will invest in liquid and \\nlow-risk debt instruments, in a manner specified by SEBI. \\n \\n2.2.11 Categories of AIFs \\n \\nAll the types of funds that have been described above are divided into three categories under \\nthe SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations for the purpose of registration and other \\noperational requirements. These categories are mentioned below. \\n \\nCategory I AIF is an AIF that invests in start-ups, early stage ventures, social ventures, SMEs, \\ninfrastructure or other sectors or areas which the government or regulators consider as \\nsocially or economically desirable and shall include Venture Capital Funds, SME Funds, Social \\nImpact Funds, Infrastructure Funds Special Situation Funds and such other AIFs as may be \\nspecified under the Regulations from time to time. Other funds that are considered \\neconomically beneficial and are provided special incentives by the government or any \\nregulator are also considered as part of this Category. \\n \\nCategory II AIF is an AIF that does not fall in Category I and Category III and which does not \\nundertake leverage or borrowing other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements or \\nas permitted in the Regulations. For this purpose, AIFs such as Private Equity Funds or Debt \\nFunds, for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the government or any \\nother regulator, are included under this Category. \\n \\nCategory III AIF is an AIF that employs diverse or complex trading strategies and may employ \\nleverage, including through investment in listed or unlisted derivatives. AIFs such as Hedge \\nFunds or funds which trade with a view to make short-term returns or such other funds which \\n                                                          \\n \\n14 SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2023 w.e.f. June 15, 2023. \\n37 | P a g e  \\n \\nare open-ended and for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the \\ngovernment or any other regulator are included under this Category. \\n \\nSEBI has inserted a fourth category of AIF known as the Specified AIF.15 This category includes \\nCorporate Debt Market Development Fund as discussed above. \\n \\n2.3 Comparison of Categories \\n \\nIt may be observed from the above definitions that under the SEBI (AIF) Regulations, AIFs that \\nare economically important or socially impactful may enjoy greater benefits, under Category \\nI AIFs. Angel Funds, Venture Capital Funds, SME Funds, Infrastructure Funds, Special \\nSituations Funds and Social Impact Funds, that are considered important for employment \\ngeneration, qualify under Category I AIFs. Other AIFs that invest in unlisted securities, such as \\nDebt Funds, Private Equity Funds and Pre-IPO Funds fall under Category II AIFs. Those AIFs \\nthat deploy complex trading strategies in secondary listed markets, derivatives and or may \\nalso use leverage at fund level such as Hedge Funds qualify as Category III AIFs. \\n \\nBeing early stage investors, Venture Capital Funds are allowed to invest primarily in unlisted \\nsecurities i.e. equity, debt, preference capital or other convertible securities, of start-ups, \\nemerging venture capital undertaking or early-stage companies. Therefore, the definition \\nuses the word ‘securities’ to provide latitude to structure the investments appropriately. \\nHowever, according to the definition of Private Equity Funds, these AIFs are required to invest \\nprimarily in equity or equity linked instruments or partnership interests of investee \\ncompanies. This is because being later-stage investors, Private Equity Funds are in a better \\nposition to take equity risks in investee companies. Similarly, funds structured purely as \\nPrivate Debt funds also qualify under Category II AIFs. Table 2.1 compares and contrasts \\nbetween the categories of AIFs. \\n \\nTable 2.1: AIF Comparison \\n \\nParameters \\nCategory I AIF \\nCategory II AIF \\nCategory III AIF \\nDefinition \\nInvests in start-ups, \\nearly stage ventures, \\nsocial ventures, SMEs, \\ninfrastructure or \\nAll AIFs that do not \\nclassify under Category I \\nAIF or Category III AIF. \\nEmploys diverse or \\ncomplex trading \\nstrategies and may \\nemploy leverage \\n                                                          \\n \\n15 SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulation, 2023 w.e.f.

But risk \\nmitigation strategy is \\nto invest in smaller \\ntranches. \\nGenerally, less risky than \\nCategory III AIF. Primarily \\nseek returns from value \\ncreation and unlocking \\nvalue by investing in later \\nstage companies.   \\nComplex risk-taking \\nstrategies including \\ntrading with borrowed \\nfunds at fund level. \\n \\n2.4 Suitability and Enablers for Category III AIFs in India \\n \\nIndia has seen tremendous economic growth in almost three decades of post-liberalisation \\neconomic era, more particularly in the specific growth phases that followed. The economic \\nprosperity of the entrepreneurial class and corporate executives created several high-net \\nworth investors and family offices. India’s economic prosperity has been underpinned by the \\nincreasing tribe of billion dollar ultra-high net worth investors (UHNI).  \\n \\nNon Resident Indians (NRIs) and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have been investing in \\nIndian Alternative Investment Markets, after the FEMA Notification in 2015.16 The regulatory \\nimpetus to the Indian Alternative Investment Market has been provided with the introduction \\nof the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. These regulations provided the \\n                                                          \\n \\n16 FEMA Notification No.: FEMA 355/2015-RB dated November 16, 2015. \\n39 | P a g e  \\n \\nnecessary framework which made Category III AIFs marketable, regulated, transparent and \\nsafe for the sophisticated investors. \\nIn 2015, the Government of India announced the establishment of Gujarat International \\nFinancial Tec-City (GIFT City), in Gujarat as India’s first International Financial Service Centre \\n(IFSC). Several regulatory measures were introduced to operationalize the IFSC, which aided \\nin providing financial services that were provided by overseas financial institutions located in \\nsophisticated offshore financial hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong, Mauritius and Luxemburg, \\namong others. The SEBI (IFSC) Guidelines, 2015, provide directives to regulate activities of \\nvarious securities markets intermediaries, including AIFs operating in IFSC. \\n \\nFurthermore, the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 created a new \\nspace for special situation funds to step in looking for suitable opportunities in distressed \\nasset sector pertaining to old companies. In addition, with improved governance regulations \\nand management practices, the small-cap companies and SME sector have immense potential \\nto cater to the alternative asset class of investors. In view of these developments, the \\nCategory III AIF sector is most suitably positioned for investors and investee companies in \\nIndia in the coming years.  \\n \\n2.4.1 Category III AIF suitability based on Investors’ risk-return profile \\n \\nCategory III AIFs deploy complex strategies with a view to make short-term gains and generate \\nalpha.17 Among all three categories of AIFs, Category III AIF is the riskiest one.  \\n \\nCategory III AIFs are most suited, only for institutional investors and ultra-high net worth \\nindividuals, considering the risk-return profile of the fund. Every investor must judge the \\nsuitability of the investment in Category III Funds, to their individual risk-return profiles and \\ninvestment constraints. Category III Funds are allowed to take leverage positions through \\nFutures and Options (F&O) contracts, structured products, credit default swaps, margin \\ntrading and arbitrage strategies, with the purpose of earning speculative profits, or hedging \\ntheir current exposures in the portfolio. This adds to the overall portfolio risk for the investor. \\nInvestors, before investing, should particularly look at some of the crucial clauses in the \\nPrivate Placement Memorandum (PPM), to get detailed insights about the Fund, such as: \\n \\n• “Investment Objective and Strategy” section elaborates on the targeted securities, \\ninvestment style, sectors, geographic focus, and such other factors. \\n                                                          \\n \\n17Alpha is the excess return generated by a Category III AIF, when compared with the return generated by the \\nbenchmark index. \\n40 | P a g e  \\n \\n• “Term of the Fund/Scheme” section states the fund structure, term of the \\nfund/scheme, whether open or closed fund, final closing date and applicable \\nextension periods. \\n• “Manager/Investment Manager” section states the prior experience of the Fund \\nManager(s) responsible to take investment decisions for the Fund.  \\n• “Redemption” section states the period during which investors can redeem their \\nmoney back from the Fund. This section also provides information about the lock-in \\nperiod and the redemption fees or exit load to be paid by investors in case of early \\nredemptions.  \\n \\nFor example, let us discuss the suitability of Category III AIFs for an HNI investor looking to \\nmake investments over a one-year time horizon. The HNI investor would be hesitant to invest \\nin a “closed-ended” Category III AIF, investing in small-cap and mid-cap securities. Closed-\\nended Category III AIFs have a minimum tenure of 3 years, generally with an additional \\nmandatory lock-in period of 2 years. Investors can redeem their units after 2 years by paying \\nthe applicable exit load. Even if the Category III AIF is generating above-average returns and \\nhas appointed an experienced Manager, the investment in this Fund will not be feasible for \\nthe HNI investor given the liquidity constraints. \\n \\n2.4.2 Asset allocation for HNIs and Institutional investors through Category III AIFs \\n \\nHNI investors and Institutional Investors diversify their portfolio to mitigate concentration risk \\non investing in only one asset class. Alternative investments serve as a good diversification \\noption for HNI investors and Institutional Investors, looking to improve their target return. \\nKeeping in mind Category III AIFs further invest in traditional assets, such as listed equities, it \\nis important to allocate funds strategically in order to avoid further concentration of the \\nportfolio.  \\n \\nLet us look at an example of asset allocation for an HNI investor, considering an investment \\nin a Category III AIF: \\n \\nMr. X, aged 41 years, is having a portfolio of Rs. 100 crore and is currently invested in the \\nfollowing asset classes.  \\n \\n41 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars \\nAllocation \\nEquities: \\n \\nDomestic – Large-cap Stocks \\n25% \\nDomestic – Small-cap Stocks \\n25% \\nDomestic – Unlisted Securities \\n20% \\nFixed Income: \\n \\nDomestic – Listed Corporate Debt \\n15% \\nGovernment Bonds \\n10% \\nMoney Market Instruments: \\n5% \\nTotal \\n100% \\n \\nThe investor has capped current and future exposure to one particular asset class to \\nmaximum 40%. Mr. X is now looking to re-allocate the current investments in Domestic \\nUnlisted Equities to 2 potential Category III AIFs: \\n• Category III AIF “A” – follows a long-short strategy, investing only in Small-cap \\ncompanies, with a 3-year investment horizon. \\n• Category III AIF “B” – follows a market-neutral strategy, investing 35% in domestic \\nsmall-cap securities, 50% in overseas listed securities, primarily in Middle East, and \\nremaining 15% in domestic large-cap stocks.  \\n \\nFrom the above example, let us understand the asset allocation strategy for the investor: \\n• Based on the age of the investor, past investment experience and the current \\ninvestment portfolio, it is imperative that the HNI investor has the “ability” and \\n“willingness” to take risk and generate additional returns. Hence, the HNI investor \\nwould re-allocate to a Fund which has a high growth potential (in this case Category \\nIII AIF “A”). \\n• Based on the concentration limits, the investor will not want to allocate the entire \\namount to Category III AIF “A”, as it would result in “direct and indirect” allocation of \\nmore than 40% towards Domestic Small-cap companies. Further, by allocating to \\nCategory III AIF “B”, Mr. X would be able to diversify the portfolio and get indirect \\nexposure towards international securities as well. \\n42 | P a g e  \\n \\n• In this case, Mr. X has multiple options, either to allocate entire Rs. 20 crore to \\nCategory III AIF “B” or allocate part of funds to Category III AIF “A” and remaining to \\nCategory III AIF “B”. In the second option, the maximum allocation to Category III AIF \\n“A” would be Rs. 15 crore. \\n \\n2.5 Current Category III AIF Market Status \\n \\nCategory III AIF market has grown manifold post SEBI (AIF) Regulations came into effect in \\n2012. As on June 1, 2023, 1128 AIFs were registered with SEBI. Starting with just 21 funds in \\n2012, the industry has seen a 34-fold jump in about ten years, in terms of number of \\nregistered AIFs.  \\n \\nTable 2.2 reveals the capital commitments raised and investments made by Category III AIFs \\nover the last few years ending March 2023.18 \\n \\nTable 2.2: Commitments raised and Investments made by Alternative Investment Funds \\n \\n \\n(Rs. in crore) \\nAs on \\nCumulative net figure as at the end of period mentioned \\nCategory III AIFs \\nAll Categories of AIF \\nCommitments \\nRaised \\nInvestments \\nMade \\nCommitments \\nRaised \\nInvestments \\nMade \\nSeptember 30, 2015 \\n3516 \\n2303 \\n27485 \\n11255 \\nSeptember 30, 2016 \\n8081 \\n6010 \\n65012 \\n24862 \\nSeptember 30, 2017 \\n22657 \\n13227 \\n116085 \\n43489 \\nSeptember 30, 2018 \\n40586 \\n26755 \\n217229 \\n84474 \\nSeptember 30, 2019 \\n42223 \\n30961 \\n316863 \\n125806 \\nSeptember 30, 2020 \\n49364 \\n36963 \\n405118 \\n165673 \\nSeptember 30, 2021 \\n57953 \\n50867 \\n535008 \\n244407 \\nSeptember 30, 2022 \\n73445 \\n63176 \\n702737 \\n307845 \\nMarch 31, 2023 \\n80900 \\n71055 \\n833774 \\n337982 \\n \\nAs observed from Table 2.2 above, Capital commitments raised by all registered AIFs have \\nsurpassed Rs. 8 trillion as on March 31, 2023. It can be observed that Category III AIFs have \\nconstantly invested most of the capital commitments, after a successful fund-raise in the \\nrespective periods. For example, up to March, 2023, almost 88 percent of the cumulative \\ncapital commitments raised by Category III AIFs have been invested, as per the stated \\ninvestment strategy. Upon direct comparison, it is observed that Category I AIFs and Category \\nII AIFs been investing almost 35% of the cumulative capital commitments as on March, 2023.  \\n                                                          \\n \\n18https://www.sebi.gov.in/statistics/1392982252002.html \\n43 | P a g e  \\n \\nThis can help us draw the conclusion that Category III AIFs in India have been investing the \\nfunds faster, to generate alpha by employing diverse trading strategies, with or without \\nLeverage positions through Futures and Options (F&O) contracts.  \\n \\n \\n44 | P a g e  \\n \\nChapter 2: Sample Questions \\n \\n1.

Category III AIFs are permitted \\nto take leverage positions through futures and options (F&O) contracts, structured products, \\ncredit default swaps, margin trading and arbitrage strategies, with the purpose of earning \\nspeculative profits, or hedging their current exposures in the portfolio. Based on the \\ninvestment strategy of the Category III AIF, such as Long-short Funds, Managers may take \\nshort positions in equity securities or fixed income securities to maximise gains or for the \\npurpose of hedging the current portfolio exposure.  \\nInvestment strategies followed by Category III AIFs can be much riskier, when compared to \\nits traditional counterparts such as Mutual Funds. Hence, Category III AIFs pool money from \\nhigh net-worth individuals (HNIs) and institutional investors, based on their risk appetite to \\ninvest in such funds. \\nCommon investments using Category III AIF structure are made by PIPE (Private Investment \\nin Public Equity) Funds, Hedge Funds and similar funds which use diverse and complex \\ninvestment strategies to make investments in listed and unlisted equities, derivatives, \\n46 | P a g e  \\n \\ncurrencies, convertible securities and fixed income securities, as specified by the SEBI (AIF) \\nRegulation, 2012.19 \\nCategory III AIFs can directly invest into an investee company or invest through units of other \\nCategory I AIFs and Category II AIFs, registered with SEBI, without labelling themselves as a \\nFund of AIFs.20 Category III AIFs are governed by the investment restrictions and regulations \\nmentioned in the SEBI (AIF) Regulations. \\n \\n3.2 Characteristics of Category III AIF \\n \\nCategory III AIFs follow a stated investment strategy, mentioned in its offer document, or \\nPrivate Placement Memorandum (PPM). The PPM is issued by the Category III AIF Investment \\nManager or Sponsor of the fund to prospective investors for the purpose of inviting \\nsubscriptions to units of a new scheme.  \\n \\n“Unit” means beneficial interest of the investors in the AIF or a scheme of the AIF and maybe \\nfully or partly paid-up. Partly paid-up units represent the portion of the committed capital \\ninvested by the investor in AIF or scheme of the AIF.21 \\n \\nThe PPM sets out the broad terms and conditions subject to which the fund is proposed to be \\noperated, associated risk factors, potential conflicts of interests, fee structure, distribution \\nwaterfall, taxation aspects, applicable regulatory norms and necessary disclosures in \\nconnection therewith. The PPM of a Category III AIF is of particular relevance to distributors \\nand is fundamental to marketing the right product to investors as well as explaining the \\npotential return and risks therein. \\n \\n❖ Investment Strategy: \\nThe investment strategy describes the type(s) of asset classes in which the Category III AIF will \\ninvest in. For example, if the Fund proposes to invest in equities, the investment strategy will \\noutline the following: \\n• Market-capitalization of Target Companies – The Category III AIF states whether they \\naim to invest in small-cap companies, mid-cap companies or large-cap companies, \\nbased on the expertise of the investment manager and the risk-return profile of the \\n                                                          \\n \\n19PIPE Funds purchase securities of a publicly traded stock, at a discount to the Current Market Price of such \\nsecurity being traded, whether in the primary market or secondary market. \\n20 Vide SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HI/IMD-IDF6/P/CIR/2021.584 dated June 25, 2021 on Circular on Amendment to \\nSEBI (AIF) Regulations, 2012. \\n21 Inserted by  the  SEBI  (Alternative  Investment  Funds)  (Fourth  Amendment)  Regulations, 2018 w.e.f. \\nAugust 13, 2021. \\n47 | P a g e  \\n \\nFund. Many Category III AIFs willing to take higher risk may also choose to invest in \\nSME companies or micro-cap companies or by taking exposure through securitized \\ndebt instruments. Some Category III AIFs also make overseas investments in listed \\ninvestee companies. \\n \\n• Investment Style – Category III AIFs may prefer investing in Value Stocks, i.e. \\ncompanies which are generally under-priced at present market prices and have a \\nreasonable future growth trajectory, or Growth Stocks, i.e. companies with high \\ngrowth projections and have expected growth rates in sales/profit to be higher than \\nthe industry average. Managers can also use a GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price) \\ninvestment style, which combines the tenets of Value Investing and Growth Investing, \\nwhile making stock selection. \\n \\n• Asset Allocation and Stock Selection – Category III AIFs may take diversified positions \\nor concentrated positions in Value stocks or Growth stocks, based on the investment \\nstyle adopted. The Investment Manager determines industry allocation and assigns \\nmaximum weight to be given to every industry and sector, in the fund portfolio. After \\ndetermining industry weights and allocation, stock selection can be done within the \\ntargeted industry allocation, subject to regulatory limits. Managers of AIFs are \\npermitted to invest maximum 10 percent of the investable funds in one investee \\ncompany directly or through investment in units of other Alternative Investment \\nFunds. This limit for investment managers of ‘large value funds for accredited \\ninvestors’ is increased to 20 percent. However, for investment in listed equity of an \\ninvestee company, this investment limit can be calculated based on either “Investible \\nFunds” or “Net Asset Value” of the scheme launched by a Category III AIF.22  \\n“Large Value Fund for Accredited Investors” is an AIF or scheme of an AIF in which \\neach investor (other than the Manager, Sponsor, employees or directors of the Fund \\nor employees or directors of the Manager) is an accredited investor and invests not \\nless than Rs. 70 crore.23  \\n \\n• Investment Horizon – The PPM of a Category III AIF outlines the targeted investment \\nhorizon and holding period of portfolio investments, depending on the structure of \\nthe fund being an open-ended fund or a closed-ended fund. Managers of open-ended \\nCategory III AIFs should ensure that there is sufficient liquidity in the fund to meet \\npotential redemption calls of investors. \\n \\n• Investment Approach – Based on the investment strategy, targeted allocations, risk-\\nreturn objective and the time horizon of investments of the Category III AIF, the \\nInvestment Manager shall frame the preferred investment approach for making \\n                                                          \\n \\n22 Inserted by the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2022 w.e.f. March 16, 2022. \\n23 Inserted by the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Third Amendment) Regulations, 2021 w.e.f. August 3, 2021. \\n48 | P a g e  \\n \\ninvestments. One Manager may take leverage, short positions in equities or \\nderivatives exposure with the objective of earning profits in trading; while another \\nInvestment Manager may take derivatives exposure with the objective of hedging the \\ninherent market risk in portfolio investments.  \\nThe Investment Strategy of a Category III AIF is discussed in detail in Unit 7. \\n❖ Professional Managers and Fee-Structure: \\nManagers of AIF and their team managing the Category III AIF are experts in capital markets \\nand investment, especially in the industry or sector or geography the fund is investing in. Most \\nmanagers come with minimum 5 years of experience dealing in equities, fixed income \\nsecurities and derivatives and hence are able to take an investment call on behalf of their \\ninvestors.  \\nFor the investment management services provided by the fund management team, Managers \\ncharge a fixed Management Fee, generally 1 percent to 2 percent on Total Capital \\nCommitments made by the unit-holders. Over and above the fixed fees, Managers can charge \\nan Incentive Fee which is a share in ‘Profit’ or ‘Additional Return’ earned by the Fund, in excess \\nof the Hurdle Rate set in the PPM.24 Incentive Fees can range from 0 to 20 percent of the \\nAdditional Return, depending on the size of the assets managed by the fund, years of \\noperation, total capital invested and hurdle rate. \\nThe Fee Structure of a Category III AIF is discussed in detail in Unit 6. \\n❖ Liquidity: \\nIn order to execute complex investment strategies, Managers need consistent capital inflows \\nand freedom to use leverage. Managers may not be able to produce the required return on \\ncapital, if there are multiple redemptions by investors. Untimely redemptions can force \\nmanagers to exit positions at undesired price levels. As per the present taxation structure, \\nCategory III AIFs are required to pay income tax on income earned from investments, which \\ncan be a significant cash out-flow for some funds, based on their legal and taxation structure. \\nHence, investors in Category III AIFs may be required to lock-in their capital, once they invest \\nin the Fund, for a particular period of time. \\nHowever, considering the risk factors inherent in Category III AIF investment strategies, it is \\nfair for investors to be given flexibility to exit from the fund, in case the manager does not \\nperform as per expectations or takes unexpected risk, in order to provide the target return.  \\n                                                          \\n \\n24Hurdle Rate is the minimum rate of return to be accrued to fund investors every year, of the fund operation. \\n49 | P a g e  \\n \\nHence, Category III AIFs have the option of being structured as open-ended funds or closed-\\nended funds. Category III AIFs structured as closed-ended funds offer limited redemption \\noptions to the investors, as compared to open-ended funds. \\n❖ Portfolio Diversification: \\nCategory III AIFs invest in multiple asset classes, based on their investment strategy. \\nInvestment Managers offer a range of investment opportunities, which may otherwise not be \\navailable to investors who invest directly in securities market. Investment Managers of \\nCategory III AIFs can provide increased benefits of portfolio diversification to an investor, with \\na diversified investment strategy, use of leverage and derivative exposures. \\n❖ Investors: \\nCategory III AIF investors need to face the risk of illiquidity and increased market risks, on \\naccount of derivative exposures and use of leverage. Depending on macro environment such \\nas market sentiments, government reforms and other global factors which are not in control \\nof the Investment Manager of AIF, the returns of the Fund may fluctuate and increase the \\noverall volatility of the portfolio. \\nInvestors willing to invest in Category III AIFs must be aware of such risks and accordingly be \\ncapable to climb the risk-return trade-off, in search for superior returns.  \\n❖  Taxation: \\nCategory III AIFs are liable to pay income tax on income earned as interest, dividend, profits \\nearned and capital gains on transfer of securities. Unlike Category I AIFs and Category II AIFs, \\nCategory III AIFs are presently not entitled the benefits of pass-through tax status. Therefore, \\nany taxable source of income is first charged to the Category III AIF and the fund is liable to \\npay tax on such income earned.  \\nThe Taxation structure of a Category III AIF is discussed in detail in Unit 9. \\n \\n3.3 Concepts prevalent in the Category III AIF industry \\n \\nThe AIF industry is nurtured by the private capital ecosystem that consists of primarily (a) the \\ninvestors, looking out for alternative investment opportunities, (b) the alternative investment \\nmanagers, having the expertise to identify, invest, manage and harvest the returns for \\ninvestors, (c) the sponsors, who initiate and float the Category III AIFs (more often the \\ninvestment managers themselves) and (d) the external service providers who facilitate and \\nmake up the ecosystem. With the advent of an organized AIF industry and introduction of the \\nSEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, Category III AIFs have witnessed \\n50 | P a g e  \\n \\nsignificant growth after 2012 and many of these constituents of the private capital ecosystem \\nare taking shape rapidly. \\n3.3.1 Category III AIF Ecosystem: \\n \\n3.3.1.1 Investors \\n \\nIn the global markets, the following entities are some of the key investors in the hedge fund \\nindustry: \\n \\nFoundations and Endowments: A Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that donates \\nfunds and provides support to other organizations, for charitable purposes. An Endowment is \\nan investment fund established by an individual or institution, such as a university, hospital, \\nor foundation, to be used for pre-defined purposes, with a principal protection objective. \\nFoundations and Endowments have long-term horizons and large corpuses, which enable \\nthem to invest over longer gestation periods and manage the risk of illiquidity. \\n \\nInsurance Companies and Pension Funds: Investments from both private and public sector \\npension funds have been a significant catalyst in the growth of Category III AIFs and hedge \\nfunds, globally. Insurance companies are ideally positioned with large, long-term, corpuses to \\nbecome AIF investors.  \\n \\nIn India, Insurance Companies and Pension Funds have regulatory caps on their asset \\nexposures in alternative investments in the unlisted space in particular. Since these funds \\nform the largest pool of domestic capital in India, their role is crucial in the development of \\nCategory III AIF industry in India. \\n \\nSovereign Wealth Funds (SWF): In recent times, due to large trade surpluses generated by oil \\ntrade and global commerce, Sovereign Wealth Funds were started by several countries such \\nas members of the OPEC, China, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia. These SWFs allocate funds in \\nvarious sectors of the market, through the AIF route. Indian AIF Markets have witnessed a \\nlarge influx of capital from Sovereign Wealth Funds, in listed equities, start-ups, infrastructure \\ndevelopment and in the AIF market. \\n \\nFamily Offices and High Net-worth Individual (HNI) Investors: In the years following 2012, \\nIndian AIF industry is being led by HNI accounts under Private Banking Managers and \\ninvestment advisors, family offices, corporate investors, domestic bank promoted AIF funds \\nand offshore investors. Family Office Consultants have played a vital role in deploying funds \\n51 | P a g e  \\n \\nto the AIF Industry, as a diversification tool. HNI Investors have shown keen interest in long-\\nterm, high-risk investments, apart from the traditional investments in real estate, gold and \\nequities. \\n \\nFund of Funds: A Fund of Funds is a pooled investment vehicle, which invests in other AIFs in \\nthe industry, with the purpose of achieving greater diversification across different investment \\nstrategies. Separately Managed Accounts (SMA) are a carve-out, from the fund structure. \\nWhile Indian Fund of Funds are still at their infancy stages, global markets have witnessed a \\nsignificant growth in the Fund of Funds AUM, which stands at 6.35 percent of the Total Hedge \\nFunds AUM globally.25 \\n \\nIndian Category III AIFs are still at a nascent stage and are poised to grow exponentially, with \\nexpectations of large capital pools from foreign portfolio investors, domestic institutional \\ninvestors and ultra-high net worth individuals.  \\n \\nSEBI recently introduced the framework for Accredited Investors (AIs) in the Indian securities \\nmarkets. As per the framework, the AIs may avail flexibility in minimum investment amount \\nand concessions from specific regulatory requirements applicable to investment products, \\nsubject to specific conditions. The concept is discussed in detail in Unit 5. \\n  \\n3.3.1.2 Sponsors \\n \\nSponsor means any person or entity that is responsible for the formation and registration of \\nthe Category III AIF with SEBI, and includes promoter in case of a company and designated \\npartner in case of a limited liability partnership. After seeking registration of Category III AIF, \\nthe sponsor invests in the capital of the company or the partnership. In case the AIF is set up \\nas a trust, the sponsor would contribute to the capital of the investment management \\ncompany. \\n \\nThe sponsors or designated partners, as the case may be, shall perform the critical functions \\nof sponsoring the fund, defining the theme, constituting the fund in the appropriate structure, \\nregistration with SEBI and formation of the initial and subsequent corpuses from time to time. \\nSponsor can also be the manager of AIFs.  \\n \\nThe sponsor should satisfy the requirements of ‘fit and proper person’ based on the criteria \\nspecified in Schedule II of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008. Any change in the \\n                                                          \\n \\n25Barclays Hedge Report, Q1, 2023.  \\n52 | P a g e  \\n \\nsponsor or designated partner shall be informed to SEBI and where there is a change in \\ncontrol of the AIF, prior approval from SEBI is required to be taken by the AIF.  \\n \\nThe Sponsors and/or Managers of the Category III AIF have the following general obligations \\nand responsibilities, to ensure transparency: \\n• Appointing a Custodian: The Sponsor or Manager of a Category III AIF shall \\ncompulsorily appoint a custodian, registered with SEBI, for safekeeping of securities \\nand shall keep custody of securities and goods received in delivery against physical \\nsettlement of commodity derivatives. \\n• Review Policies and Procedures: The Sponsor or Manager shall review policies and \\nprocedures of the Category III AIF, along with its implementation, on a regular basis. \\nThis enhances transparency and allows investors to take informed investment \\ndecisions. \\n• Audited Financials: Books of accounts of the Category III AIF shall be audited annually \\nby a qualified auditor. \\n• Dispute Resolution Mechanism: The Category III AIF, along with its Sponsor and/or \\nManager shall lay down appropriate procedures for resolution of disputes between \\nthe investors and the Fund, whether through arbitration or any such mechanism as \\nmutually decided between the investors and the Fund. \\n• Maintenance of Records: The Sponsor and/or Manager of the Category III AIF is \\nrequired to maintain, for a period of 5 years after the winding up of the fund, records \\nsuch as assets under the scheme/fund, valuation policies and practices, investment \\nstrategies, details of investors and their capital contribution and investment decision-\\nmaking process. \\n• Inspection: Sponsors and Managers are required to co-operate with SEBI by providing \\nall required information for conducting inspection of records of the Category III AIF \\nwith respect to activities of fund, assessment of systemic risk or prevention of fraud. \\n \\nThe Manager is obliged to address investor complaints, provide any information sought by \\nSEBI, maintain necessary records, ensure transparency and take all steps to address conflict \\nof interest as specified in SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations.  \\n \\nConflict of Interests:  \\nThe Sponsor and Investment Manager of a Category III AIF have a fiduciary duty towards \\ninvestors in the fund. They are bound to disclose all conflicts of interests as and when they \\narise or are likely to arise. Every Category III AIF shall have a Conflict of Interest Policy, which \\n53 | P a g e  \\n \\nhelps to identify and mitigate the potential conflicts. Investment Managers and Sponsors have \\nthe responsibility to monitor the compliance towards the conflict of interest policy. \\n \\nA Category III AIF can have potential sources of conflicts at various levels, when making co-\\ninvestments, or dealing with service providers, clients or employees of the fund. The \\nInvestment Manager shall envisage every possible conflict during the operations of the Fund. \\nFollowing are some examples of potential conflicts:  \\n \\nAt Fund-Constituent Level: \\n• Employees of Sponsor Company, Asset Management Company, Trustee and Service \\nProviders should not have potential conflicts, when disclosing material information to \\ntheir clients. \\n• No potential conflict should prevail between investors and the investment manager \\nof AIF. \\n• Employees of all companies shall put the clients’ interest over their personal interest. \\nEmployees should not solicit gifts, hard/soft commissions, among others. \\n• Conflicts, within Co-Investments by the Investment Manager, shall be disclosed to the \\npotential investors and existing investors, before any allocation being made towards \\nthese investments. \\n• Disclose the potential conflict if the Trustee is a group or associate entity of the \\nCategory III AIF, or sponsor/investment manager of the fund, or have one or more \\ndirectors in common. \\n \\nAt Employee or Staff Level: \\n• Economic interest of the employee, acting on behalf of the Category III AIF, should not \\nbe contrary to the best interest of the fund and its clients/investors. \\n• Employees should not be biased toward the result of the transaction, as a result of a \\npersonal, family, friendship or such other relationship with the counterparty. \\n• The staff member should not be employed, or act on behalf of, another entity which \\nshares the same economic interest or has the same business as the employer \\norganization. \\n \\nAll conflicts, whether present or potential, shall be disclosed to the Compliance function at \\nthe Category III AIF, generally overseen by the Investment Manager of AIF. The Manager \\nshould have internal policies within the Fund, to train employees and stakeholders in \\nidentifying the conflict, taking the recommended measure as per policy and disclose the same \\nto the Manager. Conflict of Interest Policy should briefly describe the following: \\n• Nature of potential conflicts of interest which could arise at various levels of the Fund. \\n54 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Methodology proposed to be adopted by the Manager for effective mitigation of \\nconflicts. \\n• Disclosure mechanism to inform investors about the risk arising out of such potential \\nconflicts and seek their acknowledgement towards existence of potential investment \\nrisks \\n \\n3.3.1.3 Trustees \\n \\nA Trustee or Trustee Company is appointed when the Category III AIF is constituted as a Trust. \\nHowever, there is no requirement for appointment of a Registered SEBI Trustee under SEBI \\n(Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. Though these Regulations do not \\nspecifically provide for the qualification requirements for trustees, they do have laid down \\nthe code of conduct for trustees. SEBI reviews the appointment of the trustee at the time of \\nregistration of the AIF and subsequent changes need to be notified and approved by SEBI.  \\n \\nThe trustee should be a person of ability, integrity and not be guilty of moral turpitude, any \\neconomic offence or violation of any securities law. The trustee cannot be the manager, \\ndirector (including independent director), officer, employee of an investment management \\ncompany.  \\n \\n3.3.1.4 Investment Managers \\n \\nInvestment Manager is the person or entity that is appointed by the Sponsor of the Category \\nIII AIF, to manage its investments and may also be same as the sponsor of the Fund. The \\nInvestment Manager should have the necessary skill and expertise to identify favourable \\ninvestment opportunities and have a minimum 5 years of work experience in financial \\nservices, investment planning, portfolio management and investment management. \\n \\nThe Investment Managers should be able to frame a suitable investment strategy, as per the \\neconomic cycles, market sentiments, time horizon and exit strategy or redemption plan of the \\nfund. Investment managers also need to keep investors informed of the progress of the fund, \\ninvestments made, key terms of the fund, new developments in the industry impacting the \\nfund, launch of follow on funds and so on. \\n \\nThe Investment Managers should satisfy the requirements of ‘fit and proper person’ based \\non the criteria specified in Schedule II of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008. Any \\nchange in the appointment of Investment Manager shall be informed to SEBI and where there \\n55 | P a g e  \\n \\nis a change in control of the investment management company, prior approval from SEBI is \\nrequired to be taken by the AIF. As per SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, \\nthe Category III AIF appoints an asset management company in which the investment \\nmanagers are the principal executives and key managerial personnel. In limited liability \\npartnership (LLP) structure that is widely prevalent abroad, the investment managers are \\nknown as general partners or GPs. \\n \\n3.3.2 Capital Commitment and Sponsor Commitment \\n \\nCapital commitment refers to the total funds to be contributed by investors for subscription \\nto the Category III AIF, during the life of the fund. Individual capital commitments of each \\ninvestor are based on their capital allocations to the Category III AIF, which may be different \\nfor institutional investors and non-institutional investors. Under the SEBI (Alternative \\nInvestment Funds) Regulations, 2012, a Category III AIF shall not accept from an investor, a \\ncapital commitment of value less than Rs. 1 crore. 26 However, if the investors are the \\nemployees or directors of the Category III AIF or the employees or directors of the Manager, \\nthe minimum investment value by such employees or directors is Rs. 25 lakhs. Each scheme \\nof the Category III AIF shall have a total corpus, i.e. total of capital commitments raised from \\ninvestors, of a size of not less than Rs.20 crore. \\n \\nPartly paid-up units shall represent the portion of committed capital invested by the investor \\nin Alternative Investment Fund or scheme of the Alternative Investment Fund. \\nCapital commitment provides certainty of funds to the manager so that investments can be \\nplanned accordingly. Usually, a commitment period is specified in the investment agreement, \\nduring which the capital committed is called-up by the manager, by making ‘capital calls’.  \\n \\nSponsor commitment is the financial investment required from the sponsor or the manager \\nof the AIF. This commitment from the sponsor / manager is necessary to demonstrate the \\nalignment of interests between them and the AIF, so that the investors are assured of their \\nbest interests being taken care of in the future. As per the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) \\nRegulations, 2012, the Sponsor or Manager of a Category III AIF shall have a continuing \\ninterest of not less than 5 percent of the corpus of the fund or Rs. 10 crore whichever is lower. \\nThe commitment shall be in the form of investment in the scheme of the fund and shall not \\nbe through the waiver of management fees. In other words, the commitment shall be \\ndemonstrated through a cash investment by the Fund Sponsor or Manager and putting their \\ncapital at risk on par with that of other investors in the fund, till end of the tenure of the fund. \\nThe Manager or Sponsor shall disclose their investment in the Category III AIF to the investors. \\n                                                          \\n \\n26 Not applicable to Accredited Investors, as per SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Third Amendment) \\nRegulations, 2021 w.e.f. August 3, 2021. \\n56 | P a g e  \\n \\nSuch continuing interest cannot be withdrawn from the fund and will remain locked-in until \\ndistributions to investors are completed in full. \\n \\n3.3.3 Drawdown and Capital Invested \\n \\nDrawdown is the process by which the manager of a Category III AIF will call the capital \\ncommitment from its investors, as per the funding requirements and investment strategy of \\nthe fund. These are known as ‘capital calls’. Drawdown is usually made in accordance with \\nthe capital call schedule, mutually agreed with the investors in the Contribution Agreement.27 \\nCapital calls are issued by the Manager on the dates specified in the Agreement, which \\nrequires investors to deposit requisite capital amount by a pre-specified date and through a \\nspecific method of payment. \\n \\nManagers should provide adequate details of how drawdowns are proposed to be made, \\nwhich includes the following: \\n▪ Schedule of drawdown: The schedule should mention the amount of initial drawdown \\nand the amount and timings of the subsequent drawdowns to be made during the \\ncommitment period, which can be a fixed periodic drawdown or drawdown on an ‘as-\\nneeded’ basis. \\n▪ Notice period: The number of days for the drawdown of capital. In case of failure of \\nan investor to honour the capital calls, the agreement mentions about applicable \\ninterest fee and penalties, and further steps to be taken by the Investment Manager. \\n▪ Investor Class-wise schedule: Total amount of drawdown for each class of units issued \\nto investors and the associated timelines. \\n▪ Mode of issuance of drawdown notice: Drawdown notice can be delivered physically \\nor via email notices. Other modes of issuance used by the Category III AIF should be \\nclearly communicated to the investors. \\n \\nCapital Invested is the total amount drawn down by the manager, from the investors in the \\nCategory III AIF, for the purpose of making investments. For example, a Category III AIF \\nscheme closes with total capital commitment of Rs. 1000 crore. As and when investments are \\nready for being financed, the manager will issue draw down notices to the investors to deposit \\nthe capital call payment with the fund. At a given time, if the total drawn down amount is Rs. \\n650 crore, the ‘Invested Capital’ of the AIF would be Rs. 650 crore, as against a ‘Committed \\nCapital’ of Rs. 1000 crore. The undrawn amount of Rs. 350 crore is known as ‘Dry Powder’. \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n27Contribution Agreement records the terms on which an investor participates in a Category III AIF. \\n57 | P a g e  \\n \\nSince drawdowns are subject to the investment requirements and strategy implemented by \\nthe Manager, it is difficult for investors to forecast the timing of a capital call, in case of a \\ndrawdown on an ‘as-needed’ basis. Investors have to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital, \\nin order to honour the capital calls during the drawdown period. In some cases, it is possible \\nthat the total drawdowns by the Category III AIF Manager are less than the total \\ncommitments, which may lead to an early termination of the fund. Similarly, it is possible that \\nan investor has failed to honour a capital call, due to liquidity concerns or mis-timing the \\ncapital call. \\n \\n3.3.4 Due Diligence \\n \\nIn legal parlance, due diligence is generally defined to mean processes that ensure enough \\nsafeguards are taken and reasonable care is exercised in protecting the interests of the party, \\nconducting investigation or due diligence and to avoid harm to third persons or their property. \\nDue diligence is of high significance in matters relating to investments, securities markets and \\ncorporate businesses. Alternative investments require even greater care in meeting the \\nchallenges of performing due diligence.  \\n \\nFor Category III AIFs, due diligence is necessary to be conducted at two levels –  \\n▪ At the fund level: When investors or unit holders need to subscribe to the corpus of \\nthe Category III AIF, it is imperative to perform due diligence on the operational risks, \\nmarket risks, regulatory and compliance risks, strategy risk and reputational risk faced \\nby such funds. \\n▪ At Investee Company Level: Financial and Business due diligence is significant from the \\nperspective of the Category III AIF, to understand the investment risks in the proposed \\ninvestment that is being marketed to a prospective unit holder. \\n \\n3.3.5 Environmental, Social and Governance  \\n \\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance or ESG is a generic term for evaluating corporate \\nbehaviour and is used interchangeably with sustainable, responsible, impact or ethical \\ninvestment. ESG is a fast emerging investment protocol in the world of corporate \\ninvestments, more emphatically in the realm of alternative investing. ESG norms are \\nprogressively defining the way businesses should operate. By supporting companies that are \\ncompliant with ESG parameters, investors can help create a positive ecosystem of responsible \\nbusinesses, which do the right things and attract the right kind of investors, employees, \\ncustomers and other stakeholders.  \\n58 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\nThe United Nations backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is a global network of \\ninvestors that attempts to integrate ESG practices into investment practices. In 2006, the UNO \\nlaunched the PRI based on the notion that an ESG approach can impact the performance of \\ninvestment portfolios and should, therefore, be considered alongside more traditional \\nfinancial factors, if investors are to properly fulfil their fiduciary duty. Several established fund \\nhouses in India are fast becoming signatories to this network such as Kotak, SBI, Avendus, \\namong others. ESG indices in the US were launched in early 1990s—MSCI KLD 400 Social Index \\nin 1990 and several thereafter over the next 15 years. In India, ESG indices debuted only \\nrecently in 2012.  \\n \\nSEBI has introduced a Stewardship Code for all categories of AIFs, in relation to their \\ninvestments in listed equity securities.28 It is imperative for Category III AIFs to follow the \\nprinciples mentioned in the code, when evaluating potential investments and evaluating ESG \\nrisks for each investee company.  \\n \\nThe Stewardship Code is based on the following five principles: \\n• Principle 1: AIFs should formulate a comprehensive policy on the discharge of their \\nstewardship responsibilities, publicly disclose it, review and update it periodically. \\n• Principle 2: AIFs should have a clear policy on how they manage conflicts of interest \\nin fulfilling their stewardship responsibilities and publicly disclose it. \\n• Principle 3: AIFs should monitor their investee companies. \\n• Principle 4: AIFs should have a clear policy on intervention in their investee \\ncompanies. AIFs should also have a clear policy for collaboration with other \\ninstitutional investors where required, to preserve the interests of the ultimate \\ninvestors, which should be disclosed. \\n• Principle 5: AIFs should have a clear policy on voting and disclosure of voting activity. \\n• Principle 6: AIFs should report periodically on their stewardship activities. \\n \\nStewardship responsibilities include monitoring and actively engaging with investee \\ncompanies on various matters such as financial performance, operational risk, strategy, \\ncorporate governance, board structure, remuneration, etc. and material ESG opportunities \\nand risks.  \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n28SEBI Circular No.: CIR/CFD/CMD1/168/2019 dated December 24, 2019 on Stewardship Code for all Mutual \\nFunds and all categories of AIFs, in relation to their investment in listed equities. \\n59 | P a g e  \\n \\n3.3.6 First close and Final close \\n \\nWhen investment managers launch a new Category III AIF, or a new scheme of the fund, they \\nusually set a target minimum corpus to be raised, based on the investment strategy and \\ntheme. Once the Manager is successful in raising commitments over the minimum corpus or \\nhas completed a stipulated period of fund raise, it may declare a ‘first close’. This represents \\na commitment by the Category III AIF to proceed with the fund and is also a positive signal for \\nother investors who may be monitoring the fund raising process with the intent of investing \\nin future.  \\nThe Investment Manager of a Category III AIF should ensure that First Close is declared within \\n12 months from the date of SEBI communication for taking the PPM of the scheme on \\nrecord.29 \\n \\nThe manager retains the right to accept subsequent contributions from investors and declare \\nsubsequent close dates. The terms of the fund will specify that the ‘final close’ would happen \\nnot later than a specified period after the first close, with necessary approvals.  \\n \\n3.3.7 Category III AIF Fees and Expenses \\n \\nAs discussed in the characteristics of Category III AIFs, the funds are professionally managed \\nby Managers, who charge a certain fee, over and above the fixed management fees and other \\nexpenses charged to the fund. The fees and expenses charged to investors of a Category III \\nAIF are discussed below: \\n \\n3.3.7.1 Lock-in Period and Exit Load \\n \\nRedemptions for a Category III AIF may result in frequent changes in the investment portfolio \\nand a potential loss of return. In order to provide the flexibility to investment managers and \\nencourage institutional investors to participate in Alternative Investments market, the \\nmanager of AIF can put a restriction on the redemptions allowed to an investor in a Category \\nIII AIF, by enforcing a lock-in period and exit load.  \\n \\nCategory III AIFs can be structured as open-ended or closed-ended structures. Lock-in \\nconditions are specified by the Manager. A closed-ended Category III AIF generally has a \\nminimum tenure of 3 years, which is also the minimum tenure for a closed-ended Category I \\n                                                          \\n \\n29 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/AFD-1/PoD/P/CIR/2022/155 dated November 17, 2022 on Guidelines for AIFs for \\ndeclaration of first close, calculation of tenure and change of sponsor/manager or change in control of \\nsponsor/manager. \\n60 | P a g e  \\n \\nAIF and Category II AIF. A 2-year lock-in, although not mandated by the SEBI (Alternative \\nInvestment Funds) Regulations, may be prevalent for most Category III AIFs. The Manager of \\nthe Category III AIF mentions the conditions applicable for redemptions, in the Private \\nPlacement Memorandum (PPM). These conditions state the investors’ right to make full \\nredemption or partial redemption and the ‘redemption gates’. Redemption Gates provide the \\nmaximum amount of redemption permissible by investors, in every redemption period, \\nsubject to payment of applicable expenses, taxes and exit load.  \\n \\nExit Load is the additional fees charged to investors, on redemptions made after completion \\nof the lock-in period but before the expiration of stated fund tenure. Exit Load is pre-defined \\nin the PPM and depends on the Manager, investment strategy and the time remaining until \\nfund liquidation. After the Lock-in Period ends, Exit Load charged by Manager of AIF can range \\nbetween 0 to 5 percent of the NAV of the fund. Some Managers may charge a variable Exit \\nLoad, such that the investors redeeming funds early would pay a higher Exit Load. \\n \\n3.3.7.2 Management Fees \\n \\nThe reference to fees and expenses applies primarily to the management fees and expenses \\nchargeable to the Category III AIF, as per the investment agreement between the fund and \\nthe manager. Management fee is paid by the fund to the manager, which usually ranges \\nbetween 1 percent and 2.5 percent of the capital committed during the commitment period. \\nThereafter, it reduces to a fixed percentage of the actual invested capital, if it is lesser than \\nthe committed capital, or as a percentage of the underlying value of the assets under \\nmanagement (AUM) of the fund. The percentage of management fees charged can also be \\nfixed on a slab-rate system, wherein the percentage of management fee reduces, as the AUM \\nincreases. Further, investment managers also have the right to charge different management \\nfee percentages to different class of units or investors, based on minimum subscription \\namounts to the fund, or on the class of units issued in sequential order. \\n \\nManagement fees is payable to the manager even if the Category III AIF generates no profits \\nand no returns. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is payable on the management fee and is usually \\ncharged over and above the stated management fee percentage. Disclosures on fee structure \\nare made in the PPM and the terms of the investment agreement.  \\n \\nThe function of investment management is performed by the investment manager and \\naccordingly, all such associated costs must be borne by the manager and cannot be charged \\nto the fund. Such expenses may include lease or rental charges, office maintenance, travel \\n61 | P a g e  \\n \\nand outsourced support services, investment due diligence, transaction documentation costs \\npertaining to deal execution and such other costs. \\n \\n3.3.7.3 Set-up Costs and Operational Expenses \\n \\nManager of a Category III AIF can charge a one-time Set-up Cost to investors. These costs are \\ndirectly attributable to the formation of the Fund and initial sale of units of the fund, including \\nexternal legal and accounting expenses, statutory compliance costs directors\\' fees, fees or \\ncommissions to be paid to intermediaries, printing costs and reasonable out-of- pocket \\nexpenses incurred by the Investment Management team. GST and other statutory charges \\nare levied on the set-up costs.  \\n \\nA Category III AIF and the Manager incurs operating expenses in relation to their engagement \\nwith external service providers, administrative costs, tax expenses, compliance costs and \\nexpenses incurred for daily operations of the fund. Usually, investors insist on caps specified \\nto each head of expenses or the overall expenses chargeable to the fund during its life or on \\nannual basis.  \\n \\nThe Operating Expenses of a Category III AIF is discussed in detail in Unit 6. \\n \\n3.3.7.4 Hurdle rate and High-Water Mark \\n \\nHurdle Rate of Return, or ‘Preferred Return’, is the threshold return that the investors in the \\nCategory III AIF must receive, before the manager receives additional returns, if any. The \\npurpose of having a hurdle rate is to benchmark the expectations of the investors, rather than \\nto provide a guaranteed return to investors, which is neither ethical nor practically possible.  \\n \\nCategory III AIFs should compensate investors for taking higher risk of illiquidity and longer \\nterm of holding. Hence, hurdle rates have to be better than comparable market returns in \\ntraditional investments. Hurdle Rate can be correlated with the opportunity cost for an \\ninvestor, which can be a fixed return per annum or based on a reference asset or index, \\nidentified by the Manager.  \\n \\nHigh-Water Mark is the higher of the subscription price of units issued to a particular class of \\ninvestors, or the highest NAV achieved at the end of any previous financial years. High-Water \\nMark is important for the purpose of computing the incremental returns, earned by the \\nManager of a Category III AIF. \\n62 | P a g e  \\n \\n3.3.8 Additional Returns and Performance Fees \\n \\n‘Performance Fees’ or ‘Incentive Fees’ is provided to the manager as an incentive to \\noutperform the hurdle rate as well as the high-water mark of the units issued to a particular \\nclass of investors. The Additional Return for the fund is calculated as the difference between \\nthe AUM of the Category III AIF and the higher amount of Reference Hurdle or the High-Water \\nMark, as at the end of the financial year. ‘Performance Fees’ is paid to the manager, as a \\npercentage of the Additional Return, which is generally up to 20 percent of the additional \\nreturn. This is the reward for the Manager for maximising the return for investors in the \\nCategory III AIF.  \\n \\nManagers can charge performance fees in the range of 0 to 30 percent. Most Category III AIFs \\ncharge a Performance Fee of 20 percent, being structured as ‘2-20’ Fund implying that the \\nmanager gets 2 percent management fee and 20 percent additional returns. However, the ‘2-\\n20’ structure is not a standard in the evolving Indian Category III AIF market. The payment of \\nadditional returns and the quantum thereof, depends entirely on the credibility and track \\nrecord of the sponsor / manager, type of fund, investment strategy and size of the corpus.  \\n \\nPerformance Fees is assessed on exits made by the manager and are payable only upon \\nliquidation of the fund, if a Category III AIF is structured as a closed-ended fund.  \\nThe Fee Structure of a Category III AIF is discussed in detail in Unit 6. \\n \\n3.3.9 Distributions and Distribution Waterfall \\n \\nThe amount of distributions to be made to the investors in a Category III AIF is determined \\nbased on the proportion of the NAV per unit and the total number of units held by each \\ninvestor/class of investor in the fund. The Manager is responsible to determine the total \\namount of distributions available to investors, after paying/providing for: \\n• Fund expenses or any other costs, fees and expenses payable by the Fund, including \\nthe management fee. \\n• Liabilities of the Fund, including amounts required to be withheld or deducted as per \\ntaxation norms. \\n• Reinvestment of funds, as per the stated investment strategy. \\n• Meeting the prudential norms and providing for appropriate reserves within the fund. \\n• Funds to be used to pay Incentive Fees to the Investment Manager. \\n \\n63 | P a g e  \\n \\nA Distribution Waterfall adopted by the fund describes the method followed to distribute the \\ninvested capital back to all its investors and the manager, along-with the gains earned on such \\ncapital. \\n \\nA typical distribution waterfall followed by a Category III AIF is in the following order: \\n \\n1. Return of capital contribution of investors \\n \\n2. Payment of the preferred return, or the hurdle return to the investors in the fund \\n \\n3. Payment of a catch-up rate to the investment managers. ‘Catch-up Rate’ is the rate at \\nwhich residual profits, after returning investors’ capital and hurdle, will be distributed \\nto the Manager in order to ‘catch-up’ to and receive the pre-determined share of the \\n‘total profits’ of the fund, as indicated in the Performance Fees rate (generally 20%). \\n \\nWith a catch-up provision, the Manager receives a larger share in the profit \\ndistribution, after the investors’ capital and hurdle return is paid. Hence, as a manager, \\nit is advisable to have a high catch-up rate, above the pre-determined rate of 20%, as \\na higher proportion of the residual profits will be allocated to the manager. \\n \\n4. After the catch-up rate is paid to the investment manager, any excess profits in the \\nfund are then distributed to the investors, as the manager has been paid the share in \\nprofits through the catch-up clause. \\n \\nManagers prefer to include the catch-up clause in the Contribution Agreement, with a catch-\\nup rate of 100 percent. This signifies that all residual profits in the fund, after returning \\ninvestors’ capital and hurdle, will be distributed to the Manager, till the manager receives the \\npre-determined share of the total profits. \\n \\nIf the Manager chooses not to include the catch-up clause in the Contribution Agreement, \\nthen all residual profits in the fund, after returning investors’ capital and hurdle, is distributed \\namongst the manager and the investors as per the pre-determined share of the profits. In the \\nevent of limited profits, in excess of the hurdle return, the manager may not be able to receive \\nthe pre-determined share of the total profits. \\n \\nLet us understand the impact of a catch-up provision for a Manager and investors in the Fund. \\n \\n \\n \\n64 | P a g e  \\n \\nExample1:  \\nABC Fund is a Category III AIF, launched on April 01, 2021. Following are the details of the \\nfund: \\nCommitted Capital \\nRs. 50 crore \\nFund Tenure \\n3 years \\nTotal Assets under Management (at end \\nof Year 3) \\nRs. 70 crore \\nHurdle Rate \\n10% \\nIncentive Fees \\n20% of Total Profits \\n \\nCompute the amount distributed to the Manager of the Fund and investors, at end of Year 3, \\nin the following scenarios: \\na. No Catch-up Clause  \\nb. Catch-up Rate of 100% \\nSolution: \\nTotal Profit of ABC Fund: Difference of Net Asset Value at end of Year 3 and Committed Capital \\nRs. 70 crore – Rs. 50 crore = Rs. 20 crore \\nPre-determined Profit Share of the Manager: As per the Incentive Fees rate, the Manager is \\nentitled to receive 20% of the Total Profits \\nRs. 20 crore * 20% =Rs. 4 crore \\nHurdle Return for 3 years: 10% return yearly, for 3 years of the Fund Tenure \\n[Rs. 50 crore * (1.10)3] – Rs. 50 crore = Rs. 16.55 crore \\na. Scenario: No Catch-up Clause  \\n \\ni. \\nDistribution of Capital and Hurdle Return: Investors receive their capital contribution \\nand the hurdle return earned over the fund tenure \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nCapital Contribution           \\n50.00 crore \\nAdd: Hurdle Return            16.55 crore \\nTotal \\n66.55 crore \\n65 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\nii. \\nDistribution of Residual Profits: Manager and Investors share the residual profit of Rs. \\n3.45 crore (i.e. Rs. 20 crore – Rs. 16.55 crore), as per the Incentive Fees of 20% \\n \\nParticulars \\nBasis \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nManager \\n20% * Rs. 3.45 crore \\n0.69 crore \\nInvestors \\n80% * Rs. 3.45 crore \\n2.76 crore \\nTotal \\n \\n3.45 crore \\n \\nTotal Distribution: \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nManager           \\n0.69 crore \\nInvestors \\n(Rs. \\n66.55 \\ncrore + Rs. 2.76 crore)           \\n69.31 crore \\nTotal \\n70.00 crore \\n \\n \\nb. Scenario: Catch-up Rate of 100% \\n \\ni. \\nDistribution of Capital and Hurdle Return: Investors receive their capital contribution \\nand the hurdle return earned over the fund tenure \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nCapital Contribution           \\n50.00 crore \\nAdd: Hurdle Return            \\n16.55 crore \\nTotal \\n66.55 crore \\n \\nii. \\nDistribution of Catch-up Rate: Manager will receive 100% of the residual profit of Rs. \\n3.45 crore, till the manager is paid the total pre-determined profit share in total profits \\nof the fund, i.e. Rs. 4 crore. Since residual profits in Fund ABC are insufficient to \\nprovide for profit share of the manager, the entire residual profit of Rs. 3.45 crore will \\nbe distributed to the Manager. \\n66 | P a g e  \\n \\nTotal Distribution: \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nManager           \\n3.45 crore \\nInvestors            \\n66.55 crore \\nTotal \\n70.00 crore \\n \\nConclusion: \\nIt is observed that the total distribution to the Manager is Rs. 69 lakhs in the first scenario and \\nRs. 3.45 crore in the second scenario. This difference in the amount distributed to the \\nmanager is solely on account of the inclusion of a catch-up clause in the Contribution \\nAgreement. \\n \\n3.4 Investments by Category III AIFs \\n \\nIn India, traditional asset classes like public equities have been most sought after investments, \\nas they deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns, when compared to other asset classes, such \\nas fixed income securities, government bonds and fixed deposits. Category III AIFs take \\ndynamic exposures in public equities, whether or not by using a leverage strategy. Equity \\ninvestments are the most common form of investments by Category III AIFs, in large-cap \\nstocks, mid-cap stocks or small-cap stocks or in listed stocks or unlisted stocks. \\nCategory III AIFs use complex strategies, which involve the use of derivatives, credit default \\nswaps, short positions and leverage. Apart from public equities, some Category III AIFs also \\ninvest in commodities, as an asset class, using Commodities Futures and Options. This \\nprovides diversification benefits by investing across diverse asset classes.  \\nInvestments through PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) transactions are also a \\ncommon mechanism followed by Category III AIFs to get exposure in listed stocks. PIPE \\ntransactions are increasingly becoming common, with some Category III AIFs looking to invest \\nsubstantially in one single company to seek the benefits of active board management. \\nApart from these asset classes and products, Category III AIFs can also invest in marketable \\nsecurities that provide additional liquidity for payment of fund expenses. Such marketable \\nsecurities include temporary liquid investments such as liquid mutual funds, bank deposits, \\nTreasury bills, commercial papers and certificates of deposits. \\nMost common ways of investments, by Category III AIFs in India, include: \\n67 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Taking market-neutral equity positions or selling short: Category III AIFs do not \\nnecessarily have to only “buy” securities for investment. These funds are allowed to \\ntake net short positions in equity stocks or take equal number of long and short \\npositions in stock/index futures/options.  \\n \\n• Explore Arbitrage Opportunities: Category III AIFs seek to take the benefits of \\narbitrage from potential mispricing of related equity and/or debt securities. \\nConvertible Bonds and Equity shares issued by the same company can be relatively \\nmispriced in the short-term based on the Conversion Ratio offered to the \\nbondholders. \\n \\n• Event-based Opportunities: Category III AIFs also look to invest during corporate re-\\nstructuring events, to take benefits of short-term mispricing in equity or debt \\nsecurities. Corporate re-structuring events, such as mergers, are useful to identify \\npotential mispricing of equity shares of the acquiring company and the target \\ncompany, based on the conversion ratio announced in the merger. \\n \\n• Investing at Higher Discounts: Another common strategy deployed by Category III \\nAIFs are to invest in pre-IPO deals, when a growth-stage company is about to file for \\nan IPO. Before the IPO, the Category III AIF can invest up to 10 percent of its investable \\nfunds in the shares of the company which is proposed to get listed, with the intent of \\nselling shares at a higher premium. However, such investments are subject to a \\nminimum lock-in period of 6 months, as per SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure \\nRequirements) Regulations. \\nInvestment Strategies of Category III AIFs is discussed in further detail, in Unit 7. \\n \\n3.5 Comparison between Category III AIF and Traditional Investments \\n \\n3.5.1 Category III AIFs Vs. Portfolio Management Services  \\n \\nPortfolio Management Services (PMS) offer customized investment advisory and portfolio \\nmanagement services to a potential client looking to invest a minimum amount of Rs.50 lakhs. \\nDifferent investors have their own set of risk-return characteristics and constraints. A PMS \\naims at providing a tailor-made investment advisory and portfolio management service to \\nthese investors, having unique investment objectives. \\nPMS are offered individually to each investor or “client” of the portfolio manager. Hence, the \\ninvestor “owns” every security purchased by the Portfolio Manager. This is different from \\n68 | P a g e  \\n \\ninvesting in Category III AIFs, where the investors own “units” of the fund representing the \\nunderlying security. AIFs act as “pooling vehicles” and collectively invest funds on behalf of all \\nthe investors, which is not the case in PMS.  \\nMarket regulator SEBI has prescribed the regulatory framework, SEBI (Portfolio Managers) \\nRegulations, governing PMS activities. Portfolio Management Services can be in the form of \\neither a Discretionary PMS or a Non-Discretionary PMS. In a Discretionary PMS, the portfolio \\nmanager is empowered to take decisions on behalf of the investor; while in a Non-\\nDiscretionary PMS, the portfolio manager executes what the investor wants in terms of \\ninvestments. Table 3.1 draws out the comparisons between PMS and Category III AIFs. \\nTable3.1: Comparison between PMS and Category III AIF \\nParticulars \\nPMS \\nCategory III AIF \\nPooling of funds \\nPooling of investor funds is not \\ndone. Separate demat accounts \\nare created for every investor. \\nHowever, trading can be done \\nat pool or individual client level. \\nPooling of investor funds is \\ncompulsory, for collective \\ninvestment.

Mutual Funds have a stated investment \\nmandate and investment policy, as described by the Asset Management Company (AMC), \\nmanaging the mutual fund. Every AMC is backed by a sponsor company, which also appoints \\nthe Trustee and Custodian for the fund and each scheme within the fund. \\nUnlike PMS, mutual fund services are offered collectively to investors and cannot be \\ncustomized to the investment objectives of one investor. Retail Investors can also invest in \\nmutual funds, with minimum amount being as low as Rs. 500 per investor.  \\nMarket regulator SEBI has prescribed the regulatory framework, SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations, governing mutual funds. Table 3.2 draws out the comparisons between Mutual \\nFunds and Category III AIFs. \\nTable3.2: Comparison between Mutual Fund and Category III AIF  \\nParticulars \\nMutual Fund \\nCategory III AIF \\nSponsor/Manager \\nSponsor is different from the \\nManager.

These Funds are allowed to take complex investment decisions \\nand dynamic positions across asset classes, with the use of leverage, credit default swaps, \\nderivatives or short positions. \\nGlobal Hedge Funds take a risky approach to investing, with high leverage and concentrated \\npositions. Investment Managers of large hedge funds like to venture out to invest in non-\\ntraditional assets, through the Fund. These assets may include Private Equity assets, Film \\nFunds, Intellectual Property Rights, Wine Funds, Sport Leagues, Green Bonds, etc. Such assets \\nare illiquid, with non-linear pay-offs and low correlations with traditional assets such as \\nequities, fixed income securities and cash. Investment in non-traditional assets helps to \\ndiversify the fund portfolio and balance overall portfolio risk. \\nIn the North American Markets, Fund of Funds (FoF) and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) \\nare very common, other than equity-based investment strategies. In the European markets, \\nMulti-strategy Funds have got more traction apart from traditional equity-based strategies \\nand fixed-income strategies. \\nFund of Funds invest in other hedge funds, implementing different investment strategies. This \\ngives the benefit of diversification, as the investment manager of the FoF is not relying on one \\ninvestment strategy to generate returns for the investor. However, since the investment \\nmanager is investing in multiple funds, the fees charged by a FoF are substantially high as \\ncompared to single-strategy hedge funds. Fees increase due to management fees charged by \\nevery hedge fund and the additional layer of management fees charged by FoF manager. \\n71 | P a g e  \\n \\nMulti-strategy Funds, on the contrary, are hedge funds which deploy multiple investment \\nstrategies, within the same fund scheme. This gives the benefit of diversification as well as \\ncontrols the pay-out of management fees, by investors. \\nCommodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) are registered with the local regulator, National Futures \\nAssociation (NFA) in USA and follow a unique investment strategy known as “Managed \\nFutures” strategy. CTAs generally deploy systematic or discretionary investment strategies, in \\ncommodity futures, equity futures as well as currency futures. Systematic Investment \\nStrategies make use of complex algorithms to track the price movement of different asset \\nclasses, such as commodities, currencies and equities, in different geographies. Using the \\nprice inputs and pre-defined investment objectives, the algorithm is structured to take \\nsuitable exposures in the futures market across geographies. Discretionary Investment \\nStrategies rely on the judgement and expertise of the investment manager to make the \\ninvestment decision in the futures market. Managed Futures Strategy is commonly used to \\nbenefit from short-term mispricing among asset classes and derivative contracts. \\nIndian Category III AIFs are permitted by SEBI to invest in all commodity derivatives products \\nthat are being traded on the commodity derivatives exchanges. They can invest up to 10 \\npercent of the investable funds in one underlying commodity, subject to the reporting \\nrequirements set forth by SEBI.32 \\nMulti-strategy was the most common investment strategy among hedge funds worldwide, as \\nof the first quarter of 2022. This strategy was implemented by approximately 27 percent of \\nthe hedge funds, while Equity-based strategies were implemented by approximately 24% of \\nthe hedge funds across the globe.33 \\nGrowth in Category III AIFs, with the help of regulatory reforms and increasing investor \\nappetite for risks, can help investment managers explore diversified investments in the \\nalternative investment space, such as systematic or discretionary managed futures in \\ncommodity/currency markets, film funds, Intellectual Property Rights, Wine Funds, Sport \\nLeagues, Green Bonds and the like. \\nCategory III AIF can increase portfolio diversification, given low correlations to traditional \\ninvestments. These funds offer the potential for enhanced returns with a wider investment \\nopportunity set.  \\n \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n32SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DMP/CIR/P/2017/61 dated June 21, 2017 on Participation of Category III \\nAlternative Investment Funds (AIFs) in the commodity derivatives market and SEBI Circular No.: \\nSEBI/HO/IMD/DF1/CIR/P/2017/110 dated September 29, 2017 on Change in reporting norms for Category III \\nAlternative Investment Funds (AIFs) regarding investment in commodity derivatives market. \\n33 Source: Published by Statista Research Department on July 26, 2022. \\n72 | P a g e  \\n \\n3.7 Category III AIF as a Risk Management tool \\n \\nA Category III AIF should be able to identify the material risks for the fund and report to \\ninvestors, in quarterly reports sent to investors, within 60 days of end of very quarter. \\nMaterial risks include: \\n• concentration risk \\n• foreign exchange risk  \\n• leverage risk \\n• realization risk \\n• strategy risk  \\n• reputation risk  \\n• extra-financial risks, including ESG risk \\nRisk-averse investors will seek to minimize risk for a given return, while risk-taking investors \\nwill seek to maximise their return at a given risk level. In order to achieve the risk-return \\nobjective of the Fund, it is imperative for the investment manager to identify the “source of \\nreturn” for the Fund.  \\nIdentification of the source of return for the Manager is complementary to risk analysis and \\ncan provide important information on the following: \\n• Sources of “alpha” - Factors leading to outperformance by the Fund \\n• Quantification of “beta” - Sensitivity of the portfolio to market risk factors \\nIdentification of sources of income and return attribution can impact future investment \\ndecisions, as the investment manager can analyse asset classes which result in \\noutperformance or underperformance of the Fund. Hence, return attribution can add value \\nto portfolio construction, future alpha generation, and portfolio beta management.  \\n \\n3.7.1 Alpha Management  \\n \\n“Alpha” is the excess return generated by the Category III AIF manager, over and above the \\nreturn generated by its benchmark. “Active Management” of fund portfolio is an important \\nmechanism to generate alpha. Through active management of the portfolio, the investment \\nmanager attempts to outperform its benchmark by accurately identifying mispriced \\nsecurities, to buy under-priced securities and sell over-priced securities. With the \\ndevelopment of technology, Category III AIF managers are using financial algorithms and \\nmachine learning techniques to identify mispriced securities and execute trades for the fund. \\nAlpha generation is the key to achieving superior return. However, there is a risk in making \\ninvestment decisions, through active management, as the security prices can be impacted by \\n73 | P a g e  \\n \\nbroad-based market factors. For example, fear of a widespread disease in the country, or a \\nwar between two countries, can affect the global economy and even impact the growth of \\nfundamentally strong companies. Therefore, investment managers should aim at diversifying \\nthe fund portfolio, by actively investing across multiple asset classes, geographies, industries \\nand sectors.  \\n \\n3.7.2 Beta Management  \\n \\n“Beta” measures “Systematic Risk” which is the change in the returns earned by the fund \\nportfolio, on account of a change in the returns on a broad-based index. Higher the Beta for \\nthe fund portfolio, the more volatile is the fund portfolio as compared to the market return. \\nCategory III AIFs can inherently have higher Beta, as compared to traditional asset classes, if \\nthe investment manager is investing in highly volatile assets. For example, if Fund ABC takes \\nlong positions primarily in small-cap and mid-cap securities, the overall portfolio Beta will be \\nhigh, as compared to Fund XYZ which takes long positions in large-cap securities. This is due \\nto the inherent risky nature of the underlying shares in which Fund ABC is investing. This risk \\ncannot be diversified, by investing across industries, sectors and geographies.  \\nCategory III AIF investment manager is responsible to manage the systematic risk of the fund, \\ncommensurate with its investment strategy as stated in the Private Placement Memorandum. \\nHigh beta investments are likely to outperform the benchmark during bull markets, but are \\nalso likely to underperform during bear markets. In our example of Fund ABC, which is \\ninvesting in small-cap and mid-cap stocks, the investment manager should be more aggressive \\nduring bull markets, as compared to Fund XYZ.  \\nCategory III AIFs can be used by an Institutional Investor, for Alpha Generation as well as Beta \\nManagement. Let us consider this with the help of an example. \\nExample 2:  \\nAn Institutional Investor, XYZ Investments Ltd. is having a portfolio of investments, as under: \\nParticulars \\nAllocation \\nLarge-cap Stocks – Across Industries \\n40% \\nMid-cap Stocks – BFSI Industry \\n20% \\nSmall-cap Stocks – Pharmaceutical Stocks \\n20% \\nFixed Income Securities – Government Bonds \\n20% \\n74 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe Investor is considering re-allocating half the funds invested in Large-cap Stocks (20% of \\nthe portfolio) to a Domestic Category III AIF, with the following investment strategy: \\nParticulars \\nAllocation \\nNet Long Positions in Large-cap Stocks –  \\nAcross Industry \\n25% \\nNet Long Positions in Mid-cap Stocks –  \\nBFSI  Industry \\n35% \\nLong Positions in Small-cap Growth Stocks –  \\nPharmaceutical Stocks \\n30% \\nMoney Market Instruments \\n10% \\n \\nShould the investor consider the re-allocation? Does it help to improve the Alpha and Beta \\nfor the Investor? \\nSolution: \\nXYZ Investments Ltd. shall consider the reallocation of funds to the domestic Category III AIF, \\nas it can potentially help to increase Alpha, provided it is within the acceptable level of \\nsystematic risk and the manager predicts a bull market in the near term. \\nAs observed from the original portfolio, the investor was invested in mid-cap stocks in the \\nBFSI industry and in small-cap stocks in the pharmaceuticals industry.  Reallocation to the \\nCategory III AIF will undoubtedly increase the potential returns, as small-cap and mid-cap \\nstocks generally provide a higher return when compared to large-cap stocks in a bullish \\nmarket. Moreover, the mid-cap stock allocation as well as the small-cap stock allocation \\ntargeted by the Category III AIF is also in the same industry in which the investor is previously \\ninvested. This will not substantially impact the overall portfolio beta, ignoring the benefits of \\ndiversification. \\n \\n \\n \\n75 | P a g e  \\n \\nChapter 3: Sample Questions \\n1.

The Sponsor appoints the Trustee by signing \\nthe Trust Deed and the Manager by signing the Investment Management Agreement, to form \\npart of the Category III AIF. If a Category III AIF is formed as a Trust, the Sponsor appoints a \\nTrust Settlor. The Settlor could be the Fund Sponsor, Manager or a third party. Once the Fund \\nis formed, it applies for registration with SEBI and seeks for capital commitments from \\ninvestors, domestic or foreign investors. After receiving the investment contribution and \\nidentifying suitable investments for the fund, the Fund can invest directly in the investee \\ncompanies. \\nThe Investment Manager or Sponsor appoints the service providers, such as: Custodian for \\nthe purpose of safekeeping the securities on behalf of the investors, Fund Administrator for \\nmaintenance of accounts and investor reporting, Registrar and Transfer Agents for recording \\nthe buying and selling of units of the funds by investors, other professionals, such as Auditors, \\nTax Advisors, Legal Professionals and Financial Advisors etc. \\nIn a limited liability partnership structure (LLP), the sponsor of the Category III AIF is the \\nDesignated Partner and is responsible in respect of all statutory compliances stipulated for \\nthe LLP. In most of the foreign jurisdictions, the manager of the fund is known as the General \\nPartner (GP), while the investors subscribing to units in the fund are known as Limited \\nPartners (LPs). \\n \\nAs per SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, a Category III AIF can be structured \\neither as an open-ended fund or a closed-ended fund. \\nOpen-ended Fund Structure:  \\n \\nIn an Open-ended fund structure, investors contribute capital at the time of subscription. The \\nopen-ended schemes offer units to investors on a continuous basis and do not have a fixed \\nmaturity period. Hence, investors can buy units or sell units from the AIF at any time, thereby \\nmaking the corpus of the fund variable. Open-ended schemes permit investors to redeem \\ncapital at regular intervals, viz. monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. \\nClosed-ended Fund Structure:  \\n \\nClosed-ended funds are offered to investors for a limited time period, as specified by the \\nInvestment Manager of the fund, in the Placement Memorandum. Closed-ended funds \\nrequire investors to make a capital commitment from time to time, within the specified \\ncommitment period. Commitment periods for closed-end funds typically range from 3-5 years \\n                                                          \\n \\n34Skin-in-the-game is a phrase used to ensure that the Manager also bears financial risk by investing in the \\nCategory III AIF, along-with other investors, and managing the fund to achieve a common risk-return objective. \\n78 | P a g e  \\n \\nfrom the final closing date. Closed-end funds do not permit redemptions of capital at any time \\nprior to the expiration of the fund, except in extraordinary circumstances. Most Category III \\nAIFs in industry would have a lock-in period of 1-2 years, post which investors would be \\npermitted to redeem their capital by paying an exit load, for redemption/exits between \\nperiods of 2-3 years from the completion of the lock-in period.   \\nExample: A Category III AIF launches a closed-ended scheme for 5 years, with an option given \\nto investors to exit from the scheme after expiry of a lock in period of 2 years, by paying an \\nExit Load. For exits made after the completion of lock-in period, till the end of the fund tenure, \\nexit load will be paid by the investor, as per the Redemption Gates specified by the Manager \\nin the Private Placement Memorandum. \\n \\n4.1.1 Off-shore and On-shore Funds \\n \\nA suitable jurisdiction for setting up a fund should primarily allow tax neutrality to the \\ninvestors. ‘Tax Neutrality’ ensures investors are not subject to any higher taxes than if they \\nwere to invest directly.  \\n \\nOffshore Funds and Investors: India follows source-based taxation on capital gains. \\nAccordingly, offshore fund structures are used for offshore investors to invest into India to \\navoid double taxation on the same income stream. Offshore Funds are formed in countries \\nwhich have Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPA) with India. This \\nprovides offshore investors an access to several reliefs, including fair and equitable treatment, \\nprotection against expropriation, capital repatriation, an efficient dispute resolution \\nframework and other rights and reliefs. Investments made by Offshore Funds in India are \\nregulated by SEBI. \\n \\nThe Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) issued by the Reserve Bank of India allows Indian \\nresidents to remit abroad up to USD 2,50,000 per person per financial year for any permissible \\ncurrent or capital account transaction or a combination of both, subject to the restrictions \\nand conditions laid down in the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). This limit \\nis revised under the FEMA laws and is of importance when resident Indian investors are \\ninvesting in offshore funds. \\n \\nOffshore Fund Structure: An Offshore fund structure is used when there is no intent to pool \\ncapital at the domestic (i.e. India) level. Under this structure, a pooling vehicle (Offshore Fund) \\ncan be domiciled in an offshore jurisdiction, such as Mauritius or Singapore. Offshore \\ninvestors will commit capital to the Offshore Fund which in turn will make investments into \\n79 | P a g e  \\n \\nIndian Investee companies as and when investment opportunities arise. The Offshore \\nInvestment Manager can take domestic investment advice for making such investments in \\nIndia. Figure 4.2 graphically represents the offshore fund structure. \\n \\nFigure 4.2: Offshore Fund Structure \\n \\n \\n \\nOn-shore Funds: An Onshore Fund is created by a domestic Investment Manager, to pool \\ncapital at the domestic level from foreign investors and domestic investors. The Onshore Fund \\nis domiciled in India, with capital commitments from resident investors in India as well as \\nforeign investors. The Onshore Investment Manager will make investments into Indian \\nInvestee companies, as and when investment opportunities arise.  \\n \\nOn-shore Funds shall seek registration under SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations \\nand file the Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) with SEBI through a merchant banker, in \\nthe prescribed format for their observations. Figure 4.1 depicted earlier is a typical onshore \\nfund structure.  \\n \\n4.1.2  Unified and Co-Investment Structures \\n \\nIn a Unified Structure, commitments from both domestic and offshore investors are pooled \\ninto a domestic pooling vehicle (i.e. an Onshore AIF). With this structure, India-based \\ninvestment management team can earn management fee and performance fees for the entire \\nstructure at the Onshore Fund level. There is no approval required from the Foreign \\n80 | P a g e  \\n \\nInvestment Promotion Board (FIPB), for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) to invest in the \\nunified structure. General permission has been granted in accordance with the Foreign Direct \\nInvestment (FDI) Policy to accept foreign investments under the automatic route. Figure 4.3 \\nrepresents the Unified Fund Structure. \\nFigure 4.3: Unified Fund Structure \\n \\n \\nAs seen from Figure 4.3, the Offshore Fund is located in a tax-friendly foreign jurisdiction like \\nSingapore, Mauritius, Luxemburg, among other. The Offshore Fund then directly invests in \\nthe Onshore Category III AIF, registered in India with SEBI. The Category III AIF will have other \\ndomestic investors and the Offshore Fund as one of the investors. Both Funds will have their \\nrespective Investment Managers, who are paid Management Fees and Performance Fees. The \\nOffshore Fund cannot invest in investee companies directly. The Offshore Fund can invest in \\nan Onshore Category III AIF, through the Automatic Route and provide the Investment \\nContribution to the fund, as per the Contribution Agreement. \\n \\nIn a Co-investment structure, the Sponsor raises capital in separate investment pools, in the \\ndomestic jurisdiction and in the foreign jurisdiction. Separate pooling vehicles are set up in \\nIndia (i.e. Onshore Fund) and in an offshore jurisdiction (Offshore Fund). The Onshore Fund is \\nmanaged by an India-based investment manager who enters into an Investment Advisory \\nArrangement with the Offshore Investment Manager, to provide recommendations on \\n81 | P a g e  \\n \\ninvestment opportunities in the domestic market. Figure 4.4 represents the Co-investment \\nFund Structure.  \\n \\nFigure 4.4: Co-investment Fund Structure \\n \\n \\n \\nAs seen from Figure 4.4, the Offshore Fund is directly investing in investee companies or \\ntarget securities of the domestic Category III AIF, registered in India with SEBI. The Onshore \\nFund and the Offshore Fund both have their investors, who have subscribed to their units. \\nBoth Funds will have their respective Investment Managers, who are paid Management Fees \\nand Performance Fees. The Offshore Fund has a Co-investment Arrangement with the \\nOnshore Fund and the Offshore investment manager has the option to enter into an \\nInvestment Advisory Arrangement with the Domestic Investment Manager. This structure is \\nbeneficial when offshore investors do not wish to pool their funds with the Domestic Fund \\nManager, and prefer to have their own freedom to shortlist investee companies, before \\ninvesting in them. This is normally useful for large institutional investors who make \\ninvestment decisions based on their firm’s investment policies and risk-return objectives. \\n \\n4.1.3 Master Feeder Structure and Parallel Structure \\n \\nA master-feeder structure is a subordinated structure in which offshore investors invest \\nthrough a feeder fund, which in turn invests in the domestic master fund. Direct investments \\nare also accepted in the Master Fund, registered in domestic jurisdiction, in this case: India. \\n82 | P a g e  \\n \\nDirect investors can be domestic investors or foreign investors, in the form of Institutional \\nInvestors, High Net worth Individuals, Banks, Insurance Companies, Pension Funds, Large \\nCorporates, Fund of Funds and other investors. \\nFor many investors, investing directly in a fund that is registered with SEBI in India might be \\ntax-efficient, and regulatory-efficient. These investors are “direct investors.” However, for \\nanother group of investors, that might not be the most efficient way. To address the \\ntax/regulatory issues specific to that group of investors, such as Mauritius and Singapore \\ninvestors, the sponsor needs to set up a feeder vehicle/fund in that jurisdiction. Figure 4.5 \\nbelow shows the Master Feeder Structure. \\nFigure 4.5: Master-Feeder Structure \\n \\n \\nAs seen in Figure 4.5 above, an Onshore Master Fund in India is attracting investments \\nthrough Feeder Funds established in Mauritius and Singapore, in addition to its direct \\ninvestors. Management fees typically are charged at the master fund level. At the feeder fund \\nlevel, usually only a symbolic fixed absolute amount (e.g., USD 1000) is charged. The \\nmanagement fee charged by the master fund is passed on to the feeder fund managers, based \\non mutual understanding, through the net asset value (NAV) allocated to the relevant feeder \\nby the master fund. \\n \\nParallel Structure: A parallel structure is a fund structure in which offshore investors invests \\nthrough separate feeder fund(s) in each jurisdiction. These Feeder Funds then invests directly \\n83 | P a g e  \\n \\nin the investee companies, based on their investment criteria, instead of investing in the \\nMaster Fund. Through a parallel structure, high net worth individuals (HNIs) and institutional \\ninvestors can also invest in the investee companies, through the Feeder Funds. Therefore, \\nlarge investors do not need to allocate funds to a registered Category III AIF in India, like in a \\nMaster-feeder structure. Figure 4.6 represents the Parallel Structure. \\nFigure 4.6: Parallel Structure \\n \\n \\nAs seen in Figure 4.6 above, the Feeder Funds in Mauritius and Singapore are investing directly \\nin investee companies in India, along-side the Onshore Category III AIF. Since Feeder Funds \\nmake independent investment decisions, the Investment Manager of the Category III AIF in \\nIndia can provide investment advisory services to the Feeder Funds, by entering into an \\nInvestment Advisory Arrangement. Since the Investment Manager at the Feeder Fund is \\nproviding investment management services to its investors, the fee structure in a Parallel \\nStructure of Category III AIFs may be expensive, as compared to the Master Feeder Structure. \\nHowever, using a Parallel Structure, institutional investors and HNIs can make diversified \\ninvestment decisions, across jurisdictions offering tax benefits, unlike in the Master Feeder \\nStructure.  \\n \\nParallel Structures are common as different investors have different motives of investing, \\nwithin the same fund. Advantages of investing through the Parallel Structure are as under: \\n84 | P a g e  \\n \\n• \\nTax Reasons – The primary advantage of Parallel Structures is the beneficial tax \\ntreatment received by investors in offshore jurisdictions, who invest through the \\nFeeder Funds. \\n• \\nSelection of investments to be made – The investors can independently choose which \\nunderlying investment to participate in or not to participate in. Hence, if a particular \\ninvestee company is not suitable to a Feeder Fund or a Direct Investor, as per their \\nstated investment mandate and risk-return profile, they are free to opt-out of that \\nparticular investment. \\n• \\nSponsors also use Feeder Funds to place different categories of investors into \\ndifferent vehicles - For instance, large investors paying reduced management fee \\nmight be placed in one feeder fund, while all the other investors who pay headline \\nmanagement fee rates might be placed in a separate one. \\n \\n4.2 Service Providers in the Category III AIF industry \\n \\nCategory III AIFs generally have a manager and its key investment team and research \\nassociates on their pay-roll. Performing operational activities may fall beyond the bandwidth \\nfor such small team-sizes, generally consisting of 5 to 10 employees for a mid-sized fund. \\nCategory III AIF, thus, appoints various service providers for other activities related to the \\nfund. These service providers are as follows: \\n \\n4.2.1 Merchant Bankers \\nMerchant bankers are appointed by the fund to perform various activities related to launch \\nof schemes. Category III AIFs shall file the Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) with SEBI \\nthrough a SEBI registered Merchant Banker only, at the time of seeking registration or \\nlaunching new schemes.35  \\nAs per SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, a merchant banker, so appointed by \\nthe fund, shall not be an associate of the AIF, its sponsor, manager or trustee. The following \\nservices are performed by merchant bankers: \\n▪ Merchant banker conducts independent due diligence of all the disclosures and its \\nadequacy in the PPM and also provide a due diligence certificate. \\n▪ Sponsor/ Manager of the fund, through a merchant banker, files the draft PPM to SEBI \\nfor their comments at the time of first or any subsequent scheme launches. \\n▪ Merchant banker ensures to incorporate the comments, received from SEBI, in the \\nfinal PPM prior to launch of the scheme. \\n                                                          \\n \\n35 As per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD/IMD-I/DF6/P/CIR/2021/645 dt. October 21, 2021 \\n85 | P a g e  \\n \\n4.2.2 Registrar and Transfer Agents \\nSubscriptions and redemptions made by different class of unit holders must be accounted for, \\nby the Category III AIF. The Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) is responsible to oversee the \\nfunctions such as the issue of new class of units, partly-paid units, transfer of units, full and \\npartial redemption calls, payment of exit load, expenses and fees by the selling unit holder, \\netc. In addition to these functions, RTAs have expanded their scope of operations, as some \\nestablished companies also offer secretarial and administration services, along-with the \\ntraditional services. The Central Government has notified the Registrars to Issue and/ or Share \\nTransfer Agents (RTAs) to act as collecting agents.36 In this regard, SEBI issued a circular stating \\nthat all RTAs registered under the SEBI (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) \\nRegulations, 1993 shall be acting as ‘collecting agents’ to collect stamp duty on issue, transfer \\nand sale of units of AIFs.37 Therefore, appointment of RTAs by a Category III AIF is made \\ncompulsory to enable collection of applicable stamp duty. \\n \\n4.2.3 Custodian \\nAsset allocators need to consider depositories and custodians not only in the context of the \\nsecurities that they hold but also with regard to the safekeeping of assets underlying the \\ninvestment pools in which they invest. As part of this role, the custodian needs to accept and \\ngive delivery of securities for the regular investment transactions of the fund. Since securities \\nheld by Category III AIFs are in dematerialised form, the custodian is responsible for \\nsettlement of transactions and ensuring that the dematerialised investment accounts of the \\nfund reflect the correct position at any time. The custodian may perform additional activities, \\nsuch as tax withholding, proxy voting and also track corporate actions such as dividends, \\nbonus and rights issues in companies where the fund has invested.  \\nAll custodians need to register with SEBI under the SEBI (Custodian) Regulations 1996. As per \\nSEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, the Sponsors or Managers of Category III \\nAIFs should compulsorily appoint a custodian, irrespective of the size of corpus of the Fund, \\nfor safekeeping of securities as well goods received in delivery against physical settlement of \\ncommodity derivatives.38 In the case of Category III AIFs registered as trusts, the custodian is \\nappointed by the trustees. A custodial agreement is entered into between the trustees and \\nthe custodian. As per SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, the custodian shall not \\nbe a related party to the sponsors or designated partners, unless specific conditions are \\nfulfilled. \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n36 The amendments to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 brought through Finance Act, 2019 and Rules made \\nthereunder w.e.f. 1st July, 2020 vide notifications dated March 30, 2020. \\n37SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/IMD/DF6/CIR/P/2020/113 dated June 30, 2020 on Collection of Stamp Duty on \\nissue, transfer and sale of units of AIFs. \\n38Vide SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Amendment) Regulations, 2019 w.e.f May 10, 2019. \\n86 | P a g e  \\n \\n4.2.4 Fund Administrators or Fund Accountants \\nFund Administrators play a crucial support function to Manager of AIFs. They perform the \\nfollowing support activities:  \\n \\n▪ Maintenance of funds books and records \\n▪ Accounting and allocation of income and expense accruals \\n▪ Providing global regulatory compliance reporting solutions \\n▪ Providing Tax reporting solutions and services \\n▪ Conducting NAV calculation, valuation services and Risk Reporting \\n▪ Providing access to database vendors, assisting with dealing-related enquiries and \\nproviding information relating to funds, securities, prices and dealing procedures \\nPreparing manual and electronic payment instructions to settle fund expenses and \\nmaintaining an electronic payments library to ensure daily reconciliation of all cash \\nand security balances \\n▪ Co-ordinating company secretarial matters, including documentation for board and \\nshareholder meetings \\n▪ Preparing and distributing investment manager statements, interim financial reports \\nand annual reports  \\n▪ Providing necessary support to fund auditors \\n \\nMany foreign funds have the support functions of fund administration, performed through \\nFund Administrators established in India. It would be pertinent to note that Fund Accountant \\nor Fund Administrator is not a regulated function in India unlike in other developed markets. \\nCustodian also, typically, offers the said services along with its custody services and offerings. \\nThere are several other vendors which can also be used, or the functions can be performed \\nin-house, if the number of investors is small or NAV computation is not that frequent within \\nthe fund. \\n \\n4.2.5 Fund Infrastructure \\nCategory III AIFs depend on robust platforms and software for trade execution. Speed of trade \\nexecution is critical for the success for investors and investment managers. Trading Platforms, \\nused internally by the Category III AIF or outsourced to third-party vendors, help Managers \\nget real-time data on fund-level and firm-level positions, client accounts and related fees. \\nState-of-the-art technology and infrastructure are one of the most important success factors \\nfor Investment Managers, in today’s technology-driven world, as they seek data \\ndissemination from global markets, segments and geographies. Mitigation of cyber-crime \\nrisks and frauds is also a concern for Investment Managers, as they are responsible for client \\ndata in their fiduciary responsibility. \\n87 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe most common systems used in a Category III AIF are Order Management Systems (OMS), \\na real time price terminal, other databases for fundamental analysis like Bloomberg, Reuters, \\netc.  \\n4.2.6 Distributors and Placement Agents \\nOne of the key developments that would shape the growth and proliferation of the Category \\nIII AIF industry in India would be the role played by distributors and placement agents, just as \\nin the case of the mutual fund industry which grew phenomenally in India since 1994. They \\nare important in not only the selling function but in the creation of wider awareness and \\nfamiliarity among the investor community with regard to Category III AIF products, services, \\ninvestment strategies and their return potential.   \\n \\nA distributor can be empanelled with more than one Category III AIF. Distributors can be \\nindividuals or institutions such as distribution companies, broking companies and banks. \\nHowever, Category III AIF distribution skill requires proper training and thorough \\nunderstanding of the industry and the products. AIF investors are meant to be sophisticated \\ninvestors with higher risk appetite. As Category III AIFs bear a higher risk of investment, \\ninvestors also need higher risk-taking ability and willingness to invest in such assets. \\nDistributors have to understand the risk-return profile and suitability of every scheme, \\nlaunched by Category III AIFs, for their investors/clients on a case-to-case basis. They should \\nhave a complete understanding of the operations of a Category III AIF, the investment \\nstrategy deployed, targeted asset classes, industries and sectors for investments, which can \\nhelp them map the requirements of investors with the funds they distribute.     \\n \\n4.2.7 Tax Advisors \\nTax Advisors are appointed by Category III AIF managers to get advice on domiciling the funds. \\nOffshore Funds, in tax-friendly jurisdictions, have proved to be beneficial for investors and \\navoid cascading effects of taxation for Category III AIFs. Tax Advisors also serve investors, \\ntypically foreign portfolio investors, in deal structuring, tax compliance and due diligence, \\nwhen they look to invest in domestic Category III AIF market or related securities. \\n \\n4.2.8 Legal Advisors \\nDrafting of legal agreements and legal documentation is done by third-party legal advisors or \\nin-house legal counsels appointed by the Category III AIF. Legal agreements are the basis of \\nthe contract between the Investors and the Fund. Depending on the structure of the fund \\nentity, geographical location and targeted investor, legal advisors are responsible to draft the \\nlegal documents. Fund structures may sometimes be complex, which can require a number \\n88 | P a g e  \\n \\nof agreements and legal documents to be signed by various stakeholders in the Category III \\nAIF. Some of the documentation work done by legal counsels is underlined below: \\n \\n▪ Private Placement Memorandum (PPM): The PPM is the offer document made by the \\nCategory III AIF, both at Onshore Level and Offshore Level to attract capital \\ncommitments from potential investors. The PPM should contain all material \\ninformation about the Fund, such as: \\no Background of key investment team of the Investment Manager \\no Targeted investors and geographies, whether Offshore, Onshore or both \\no Class of units to be issued to investors \\no Terms and conditions on which the Manager offers investment services, its \\naffiliations with other intermediaries \\no Fees and all other fund expenses proposed to be charged \\no Tenure of the Category III AIF or the Fund scheme \\no Conditions and limits on redemption, exit load to be paid and redemption \\ngates \\no Investment strategy, risk management tools and parameters employed \\no Key service providers, potential conflict of interest, procedures to identify and \\naddress them \\no Potential conflict of interests of the investment manager, with the Category III \\nAIF, its affiliates and subsidiaries.  \\no Legal and Regulatory Norms applicable to the fund \\no Valuation Policy and mechanisms followed for computation of NAV \\no Computation of High-Water Mark and Additional Returns for the fund \\no Disciplinary history of the Sponsor and Manager of the fund \\no Dispute Redressal Mechanism adopted by the fund \\no Manner of winding up of the Category III AIF or the scheme \\no Terms of reference of the committee constituted for approving the decisions \\nof the AIF39 \\no Such other information as may be necessary for the investor to take an \\ninformed decision on whether to invest in the Category III AIF \\n \\nTo ensure that a minimum standard of disclosure is made available in the PPM, SEBI has \\nprovided a template for the PPM, and made it mandatory for Category III AIFs to provide the \\nminimum level of information, as required by their format. Category III AIFs are also permitted \\n                                                          \\n \\n39Inserted by the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2021 w.e.f. May 5, 2021. \\n89 | P a g e  \\n \\nto provide additional information in their PPM. Documentation done for Category III Fund at \\nOnshore Level: \\n▪ Investment Management Agreement: This agreement is made for the fund’s trustee \\nto appoint the investment manager and delegate all its management powers in \\nrespect of the fund to the investment manager, except for certain retained powers \\nthat are identified in the Indenture of Trust. \\n▪ Indenture of Trust: Most Category III AIFs in India are formed as “Trust” registered \\nunder Indian Trusts Act, 1882 to enjoy tax benefits provided under the Income Tax, \\n1961.This document ascertains the nature of the Trust, whether it is “determinate” or \\n“indeterminate”. Trusts are considered to be “determinate” if the individual shares of \\nthe beneficiaries are expressly stated in the trust deed and are identifiable and \\nascertainable as on the date of the trust deed. In case of an “indeterminate trust”, the \\ntrust is treated as an \\'association of persons\\' and tax is charged on the entire income \\nof the trust at the maximum marginal rate. \\n▪ Contribution Agreement: This Agreement records the terms on which an investor \\nparticipates in a fund. It includes aspects relating to computation of beneficial interest, \\ndistribution mechanism, list of expenses to be borne by the fund, powers of the \\ninvestment committee, capital drawdown mechanism, among others. \\n \\n▪ Investor Side Letters: Some large investors may ask for certain exemptions or \\npreferential treatment, by the investment manager. These requests are recorded in \\nthe Investor Side Letters. Investors seek differential arrangements with respect to \\nreduced management fee and participation in investment committees, among others.  \\nIt is important to note that the investment manager of a Category III AIF has a fiduciary \\nduty towards other investors in the fund. Hence, the investment manager should \\nensure that they are not in breach of such fiduciary duty, in an attempt to provide \\ndifferential rights to some large investors. To avoid such a breach of fiduciary duty, \\nmost investment managers create a separate class of units with differential rights, \\nissued to large investors. \\n \\nDocumentation done for Category III Fund at Offshore Level: \\n \\n▪ Subscription Agreement: This agreement sets out the terms and conditions on which \\nan investor will subscribe to the securities issued by an offshore fund. The agreement \\nsets out the investor’s capital commitment to the fund and also records the \\n90 | P a g e  \\n \\nrepresentations and warranties made by the investors, such as the investor being \\nqualified under law and declared as “fit and proper” to make investments in the fund. \\n▪ Advisory Agreement: If the Offshore Fund delegates investment advisory \\nresponsibilities to a separate entity, it needs to sign an Investment Advisory \\nAgreement which contains the general terms under which such investment advisor \\nrenders advise in respect of the transactions for the Fund’s board. \\n▪ Wrapper: A wrapper is a supplement attached to the Private Placement \\nMemorandum of the domestic fund distributed at offshore locations (in case of \\n‘unified structure’). This helps to achieve compliance with the requirements for \\nprivate placement of the securities of an offshore fund to investors in jurisdictions \\noutside India. \\n \\n4.2.9 Auditors \\nStatutory auditors and Independent financial auditors are compulsorily appointed by \\nCategory III AIFs as they sign-off on the financial statements. All the books of accounts of the \\nAIF shall be audited annually by a qualified auditor. \\n \\nIt is mandatory for all Category III AIFs to perform a yearly audit at the end of each financial \\nyear to ensure compliance of terms of the PPM. Such audit is to be conducted through internal \\nor external auditors or legal professionals. The findings of such audit, along-with corrective \\nsteps to be taken if any, must be communicated to the Trustee or Board or Designated \\nPartners of the Category III AIF, Board of the Investment Managers and SEBI, within 6 months \\nfrom the end of the financial year. Audit of sections of PPM relating to ‘Risk Factors’, ‘Legal, \\nRegulatory and Tax Considerations’ and ‘Track Record of First Time Managers’ shall be \\noptional. \\n \\nHowever, such audit requirements may not apply for AIFs: \\n(a) Large Value Funds, in which each investor commits to a minimum capital \\ncontribution of Rs. 70 crores (USD 10 million or equivalent, in case of capital \\ncommitment in non-INR currency)  \\n(b) which have not raised any funds from their investors and are required to submit a \\nCertificate from a Chartered Accountant in this regard, within 6 months from the end \\nof financial year.40 \\n                                                          \\n \\n40\\n SEBI \\nCircular \\nNos.: \\nSEBI/HO/IMD/DF6/CIR/P/2020/24 \\ndated \\nFebruary \\n5, \\n2020 \\nand \\nSEBI/HO/IMD/DF6/CIR/P/2020/99 dated June 12, 2020 on Disclosure standards for Alternative Investment \\nFunds (AIFs) and its clarifications respectively. \\n91 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe scope of such PPM audit would be: \\n \\n▪ Review of compliance with the minimum subscription for each class of units  \\n▪ Implementation of the Investment strategy \\n▪ Disclosure of the affiliates and any transactions undertaken with them \\n▪ Investment policy of the Category III AIF, if any, and review of investments undertaken \\nin accordance with the investment policy \\n▪ Review of fund flow in purchase and sale of securities on sample basis to ensure \\ncompliance with the investment strategy  \\n▪ Review of the class of units of the Category III AIF in existence during the year in \\naccordance with the class of units stated in the PPM  \\n▪ Review of the capital commitments received and drawdowns made during the year in \\naccordance with the terms of the PPM  \\n▪ Review of management fees charged for each class of units of the Category III AIF  \\n▪ Review of the distributions and additional return charged to the investors \\n▪ Review of relevant information and reference sources for data disclosed in the section \\non Market Opportunity/ Indian economy / Industry Outlook \\n▪ Ensure compliance with the disclosures required on the Scheme structure and \\nrelevant disclosures on all key constituents of the Category III AIF  \\n▪ Ensure that the Category III AIF has policy on the governance framework to check for \\npotential Insider Trading, compliance with Anti-money Laundering norms, potential \\nconflict of interests, among others \\n▪ Review the Disclosure and compliance with the list of responsibilities entrusted to \\nTrustee, Sponsor and Manager.  \\n▪ Ascertain the Role of the key investment team or investment committee and the \\ndecision making process of the investment committee or the Board of the Investment \\nManager \\n▪ Review of the practices in connection with the consequences of default by investors \\nincluding penalty, forfeiture, and suspension of rights, among others.  \\n▪ Review of working in connection with the transfer of units of the Fund or withdrawal \\nof units of the Fund/Scheme, on a sample basis  \\n \\n4.2.10 Investment Advisors \\nOffshore funds may seek investment advisory services, especially when looking to invest in \\ndomestic markets and in niche industry sectors. Domestic investment advisors sign \\ninvestment advisory agreements to seek best execution for their clients. They provide \\nindustry-specific insights and potential investee companies, commensurate with the risk-\\nreturn objectives and investment constraints of the Fund. It would be ideal to note that these \\n92 | P a g e  \\n \\nare non-binding advice and investment manager may choose to execute or leave the same. \\nThe Investment Advisors are paid advisory fees from the investment manager for their \\nservices. \\n \\n \\n93 | P a g e  \\n \\nChapter 4: Sample Questions \\n \\n1.

It monitors and regulates the \\nsecurities market and protects the interests of the investors by enforcing certain rules and \\nregulations and promoting the development of the securities market in India. \\nSEBI has introduced the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations in 2012 to regulate \\npooled investment funds in India, such as venture capital funds, angel funds, private equity \\nfunds, infrastructure funds, debt funds, social impact funds, special situation funds and hedge \\nfunds. If any Fund or person managing such Fund fails to comply with the regulations, such \\nperson will be liable to pay a minimum penalty of Rs. 1 lakh. Such penalty may extend up to \\nRs. 1 lakh for each day of non-compliance with regulations, subject to a maximum of Rs. 1 \\ncrore or three times the amount of gains made out of such non-compliance, whichever is \\nhigher.41 \\n \\n5.2 Registration of a Category III Alternative Investment Fund  \\nSEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations mandates all alternative investment funds \\nto register with SEBI and obtain a certificate of registration.

For a Category III AIF looking to raise capital commitments, the PPM is the \\nmost important and informative document as it provides all necessary information required \\nby sophisticated investors, which is not generally available in the public, to take informed \\ninvestment decisions. \\n \\nAs per the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, the Investment Manager or \\nSponsor must launch AIF Schemes after filing the PPM with SEBI, through a SEBI registered \\nMerchant Banker, at least thirty days prior to launch of scheme, along with payment of \\nscheme fee of Rs. 1 lakh.55 The application fee will not be applicable in case of a launch of the \\nfirst scheme by the Category III AIF. \\n \\nThe Merchant Banker must exercise independent due diligence of all the disclosures in the \\nPPM, satisfy itself with respect to veracity and adequacy of the disclosures and provide a due \\ndiligence certificate on a prescribed format by SEBI.56 The details of the Merchant Banker shall \\nbe disclosed in the PPM. While filing the draft PPM at the time of registration or prior to \\nlaunch of new scheme, the due diligence certificate provided by the Merchant Banker shall \\nalso be submitted, along with other necessary documents.  \\n \\nSEBI may communicate its comments, if any, to the merchant banker prior to launch of the \\nscheme and the merchant banker shall ensure that the comments are incorporated in the \\nplacement memorandum prior to launch of the scheme. \\n \\nCategory III AIFs are required to intimate SEBI regarding any changes in terms of the PPM on \\na consolidated basis, within 1 month of the end of each financial year. Such intimation shall \\nalso be submitted through a Merchant Banker, along with the due diligence certificate. \\n \\nLarge Value Funds schemes are exempt from filling their PPM through Merchant Bankers or \\nincorporate comments by SEBI, as these schemes are launched under “intimation to SEBI” \\nmodel. The PPM for Large Value Fund schemes are filed with SEBI along with a duly signed \\nand stamped undertaking by CEO and Compliance Officer of the Manager to the Category III \\nAIF in SEBI prescribed format.57  \\n  \\n                                                          \\n \\n55 Not applicable for Large Value Fund of Accredited Investors \\n56 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/IMD/IMD-I/DF6/P/CIR/2021/645 dated October 21, 2021 on Modalities for filing \\nof placement memorandum through a Merchant Banker under SEBI (AIF) Regulations, 2012. \\n57 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/AFD/RAC/CIR/2022/088 dated June 24, 2022 on Guidelines for Large Value Fund \\nfor Accredited Investors under SEBI (AIF) Regulations, 2012 and Requirement of Compliance Officer for \\nManagers of all AIFs. \\n110 | P a g e  \\n \\nIt may be emphasized that, SEBI provides only observations on the PPM submitted to them \\nand does not approve the document. The below text is generally shared by SEBI with all the \\nAIFs submitting their PPMs: \\n \\n“It is to be distinctly understood that submission of the PPM to SEBI should not in any way be \\ndeemed or construed that the same has been cleared or approved by SEBI. SEBI does not take \\nany responsibility for the accuracy and correctness of disclosures, facts and claims made in the \\nPPM and the capability and performance of the Manager. It is Manager’s responsibility to take \\nall reasonable care to ensure that the information in the PPM is true and accurate in all \\nmaterial respects and in compliance with SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, \\n2012 and other applicable laws and that there are no material facts, the omission of which \\nwould make any statement in this memorandum, whether of fact or opinion, misleading. This \\nrequirement is to facilitate investors to take an informed decision for making investment in \\nthe proposed Fund/Scheme.” \\n \\nIn an effort to standardize the format of the PPM for registered AIFs, SEBI has issued a circular \\nwhich provides a template for submitting information in the PPM, by a Category III AIF.58 \\nAnnexure 2 to this circular provides the common template of a PPM to be used by Category \\nIII AIFs.

No scheme of a Category III AIF can adopt a ‘priority distribution model’, \\nin which one class of investors share a loss which is more than what should be borne based \\non their pro-rata holding in the fund, as other class of investors have priority in distribution \\nover such one class of investors. Any Category III AIF scheme which has adopted the priority \\ndistribution model shall not accept fresh commitments or make investments in a new \\ninvestee company, until SEBI gives further clarification in this regard.60 \\n \\n5.6 Guidelines on Operational, Prudential and Reporting Norms \\n \\nIt is mandatory for all registered Category III AIFs to comply with the directions issued by SEBI \\nfrom time to time, with respect to operational standards, conduct of business rules, \\nprudential requirements, restrictions on redemptions and conflict of interest. Such \\ndisclosures and compliance ensure that Investment Managers are not taking excess leverage \\nin the Fund, managing risk effectively and conducting the business of the Fund for the benefit \\nof the investors.  \\n \\nSEBI, in this regard, has issued a couple of circulars which provide detailed guidelines for all \\nregistered Category III AIFs, with respect to the Operational, Prudential and Reporting \\nNorms.61 The guidelines are discussed below:  \\n \\n5.6.1 Risk Management and Compliance \\n \\nIf a Category III AIF deploys leverage, the Fund must ensure that it: \\n \\no implements a comprehensive risk management framework, with independent \\nrisk management function commensurate with the size, complexity and risk \\nprofile of the fund. \\n                                                          \\n \\n60 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/AFD-1/PoD/P/CIR/2022/157 dated November 23, 2022 on Schemes of AIFs which \\nhave adopted priority in distribution among investors \\n61SEBI Circular Nos.: CIR/IMD/DF/10/2013 dated July 29, 2013 on Operational, Prudential and Reporting Norms \\nfor Alternative Investment Funds and CIR/IMD/DF/14/2014 dated June 19, 2014 on Guidelines on disclosures, \\nreporting and clarifications under AIF Regulations. \\n116 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\no maintains independent compliance function with suitable operational \\nresources, infrastructure, checks and controls. \\n \\no maintains records of all trades and transactions performed in the Fund and \\nmakes it available to SEBI, when required. \\n \\no provides full disclosures of present and potential conflict of interests along \\nwith its resolution mechanisms to the investors and SEBI.  \\n \\n5.6.2 Redemption Norms \\n \\nThe following redemption norms, as specified by SEBI, are applicable to all open-ended \\nCategory III AIFs: These norms do not apply to closed-ended funds due to their unique \\nfund structure. \\n \\no Investment Managers must ensure sufficient liquidity in the Fund/Scheme in \\norder to meet redemption obligations. The Investment Manager should \\nestablish and maintain efficient liquidity management policy and process to \\nensure that liquidity of the fund assets is consistent with overall liquidity \\nrequirements of the Fund, when making investments. \\n \\no Investment Managers must disclose the possibility of suspension of \\nredemptions in exceptional circumstances. Such suspension shall be justified, \\nonly if it deemed to be in best interest of the investors or as required by SEBI.  \\n \\no Investment Managers shall build required operational efficiency and capability \\nto suspend the redemptions, and shall not accept any new subscriptions or \\ncommitments from investors, during the period of such suspension. \\n \\no Follow-on action after suspension of redemptions: \\n▪ The decision of suspension, with sufficient reasons and future actions, \\nmust be documented by the Investment Managers and communicated \\nto SEBI and investors. The Investment Managers must also regularly \\nreview the suspension.  \\n▪ The Investment Manager must take all necessary steps to resume \\nnormal operations as soon as possible, in the best interest of investors. \\nSuch decision to resume normal operations shall also be \\ncommunicated to SEBI and the investors. \\n \\n5.6.3 Prudential Norms \\n \\nA Category III AIF may take leverage, whether through investments in derivative contracts \\nor by borrowed money, for the purpose of investing in securities market. However, SEBI \\nhas prescribed that the leverage of a Category III AIF shall not exceed 2 times of the net \\n117 | P a g e  \\n \\nasset value (NAV) of the fund. For the purpose of limiting leverage taken by the Fund, SEBI \\nhas prescribed the ratio to compute the maximum permissible leverage by the Fund, as \\nunder: \\n \\nLeverage =  Total exposure {Long positions + Short positions (after offsetting as \\npermitted)} \\nNet Asset Value (NAV) \\n \\ni.e. the leverage of a Category III AIF shall not exceed 2 times of the net asset value (NAV) \\nof the fund. \\n \\nNet Asset Value (NAV) of the AIF shall be the sum of value of all securities adjusted for \\nMark-to-market   gains/losses (including   cash   and   cash equivalents). The NAV shall \\nexclude any funds borrowed by the AIF. \\n \\nFor instance, if the current Assets under Management of Fund ABC as on March 31, 2020 \\nis Rs. 50 crore, then the total exposure taken in the fund, after offsetting long positions \\nand short positions shall not exceed Rs. 100 crore. It may be noted that the leverage ratio \\nshall be calculated at the scheme level. \\n \\nCategory III AIFs investing in units of other AIFs may undertake leverage not exceeding 2 \\ntimes the NAV, which excludes the value of investment in units of other AIFs.62  \\n \\nBreach of Leverage Limits: \\n \\nAll registered Category III AIFs shall monitor leverage limits, as prescribed by SEBI, on a \\ncontinuous basis and have adequate infrastructure for the purpose. The Category III AIFs must \\nreport the amount of leverage at the end of the day, based on closing prices, to the custodian \\nby the end of next working day. The Category III AIFs must also report any breach of leverage \\nlimit during the day. \\n \\nIn case a breach of limit is reported by the Category III AIF, the Category III AIF and the \\ncustodian have their respective duties to inform the investors and SEBI about such breach, in \\nthe following manner: \\n \\no Reporting Obligation of Category III AIF: \\n \\n▪ The Category III AIF must report the breach of the leverage limit to the \\nCustodian. \\n \\n▪ The Category III AIF must send a report to all the investors before 10:00 \\nAM on the next working day, informing them about the breach and reasons \\nfor such breach. \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n62 As per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD-I/DF6/P/CIR/2021/584 dated June 25, 2021 \\n118 | P a g e  \\n \\n▪ The Category III AIF must square-off (sell/buy) the excess exposure taken \\nin any security or derivate contract by end of the next working day, in order \\nto be within the leverage limit. A confirmation of such square-off must be \\nsent to all investors by end of the same day. \\n \\no Reporting Obligation of Custodian: \\n \\n▪ The Custodian shall send a report to SEBI, mentioning the name of the \\nCategory III AIF, extent of breach of leverage limit and reasons for such \\nbreach, before 10:00 AM on the next working day. \\n \\n▪ A confirmation of square-off of excess exposure must be sent to SEBI by \\nend of the same day on which the exposure is squared-off. \\n \\n5.6.4 Submission of Reports to SEBI: \\n \\nAll Category III AIFs shall submit periodical reports to SEBI relating to their activities as an AIF \\nin a prescribed format. Category III AIFs which do not undertake leverage shall submit this \\nreport on a quarterly basis, within 10 calendar days from the end of each quarter in the \\nrevised format as specified by SEBI. 63 64 Category III AIFs which undertake leverage are \\nrequired to submit reports on a monthly basis to SEBI. The reports should be submitted online \\nthrough the SEBI Intermediary Portal. \\n \\n5.7 Conditions for investments by a Category III AIF \\n \\nCategory III AIFs are allowed to invest in securities of listed and unlisted investee companies, \\nderivatives, units of other AIFs and complex or structured products. Category III AIFs can also \\ninvest in an Investee Company up to the specified concentration limit, directly or through, \\nunits of other AIFs.65 Category III AIFs may deal in goods received in delivery against physical \\nsettlement of commodity derivatives. 66  Such derivative contracts may involve physical \\nsettlement of commodities such as precious metals, base metals, agricultural products and \\nenergy products. \\nCategory III AIFs can also transact in Corporate Bonds through the Request for Quote (RFQ) \\nplatform of stock exchanges. 67To enhance transparency and disclosure of trades in the \\nsecondary market for Corporate Bonds, Category III AIFs shall undertake at least 10 percent \\n                                                          \\n \\n63 As per the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD/IMD-I/DOF6/CIR/2021/549 dated April 07, 2021 \\n64 The \\nreport \\nformat \\ncan \\nbe \\naccessed \\nat: \\nhttps://www.sebi.gov.in/sebi_data/commondocs/apr-\\n2021/GENERAL%20INFORMATION%20ABOUT%20THE%20AIF%20Annexure%201_p.pdf \\n65 Vide SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2021 w.e.f.

A Category III AIF which is authorised \\nunder the fund documents to invest in units of AIFs shall not offer its units for subscription to \\nother AIFs. 70 Existing Category III AIFs may also invest simultaneously in securities of investee \\ncompanies and in units of other AIFs, subject to appropriate disclosures in the PPM and with \\nconsent of at least two-thirds of unit holders by value of their investment in the AIF.71 \\nA Category III AIF which proposes to invest in units of other AIFs shall, inter-alia, provide the \\nfollowing information in their PPM:72 \\n• Proposed allocation of investment in units of other AIFs. \\n• The portion of fees and expenses which may be attributed to investment in units of \\nother AIFs, out of the total fees and expenses charged to the investors by the Category \\nIII AIF. \\n• Process to be followed by the Investment Manager of the Category III AIF to ensure \\ncompliance with the Investment Restrictions and Concentration Limits applicable to \\nCategory III AIFs, as per the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations. \\n• Disclosure with respect of any investments proposed to be made in units of other AIFs \\nmanaged/sponsored by the same Investment Manager/Sponsor or associates of the \\nInvestment Manager/Sponsor.

In order to treat such potential conflicts, the \\nInvestment Manager is prohibited from dealing in the same security for other clients \\nat more favourable terms which are offered to the Category III AIF. Further, terms of \\nexit including the exit timing need to be identical for both Investment manager and \\nAIF.  \\n \\nFor example, Fund ABC has appointed an Investment Manager PQ to manage \\nthe Fund Portfolio. Manager PQ has decided to buy 50 lakh shares of a small-\\ncap company, MNC Ltd. at Rs. 8.00/share. With this trade, the investment \\nmanager also wants to purchase 10 lakh shares of MNC Ltd. for three other \\ndiscretionary clients, individually.  \\n \\nIn such a scenario, Investment Manager PQ shall ensure that Fund ABC is not \\npaying more than Rs. 8.00/share when purchasing the shares. Therefore, the \\nmanager is required to purchase 50 lakh shares of MNC Ltd., if available, at Rs. \\n8.00/share in the Fund’s Account first. If there are any more outstanding \\nshares of MNC Ltd. in the market, the manager can then purchase 30 lakh \\nshares for other three clients. \\n \\n• A Category III AIF can invest in foreign entities or investee companies, incorporated \\noutside India, provided they are in compliance with regulatory guidelines issued by RBI \\nand SEBI. \\n \\n• A Category III AIF may take leverage or borrow money for the purpose of investing in \\nsecurities market, provided: \\n \\no Prior consent of investors is taken by the investment manager. \\no Maximum leverage taken shall not breach the limits specified by SEBI from \\ntime to time. Currently the maximum leverage limit is set at 2 times of the Net \\nAsset Value (NAV) of the Fund.

Such investor shall be excluded from the voting process in \\norder to obtain required approval of 75 percent of investors, by their value of \\ninvestment in the fund.  \\n \\nAn associate entity means a Company, or a limited liability partnership (LLP), or a body \\ncorporate in which a director or trustee or partner or Sponsor or Manager of the Fund, or \\ndirector or partner of the Investment Manager/ Sponsor, holds either individually or \\ncollectively, more than 15 percent of its paid-up equity share capital or partnership interest. \\n \\n5.8 Concentration Limits  \\n \\nA Category III AIF can invest up to 10 percent of the investible funds in one Investee Company \\ndirectly or through investment in units of other AIFs.

Tenure is the \\nduration of scheme from the date of first close till last day of the term as specified in the fund \\ndocuments.79 \\nIt is important to note that the 10 percent concentration limit is applicable as per the cost of \\nthe investments made by the Category III AIF, and not as per the market value of such \\ninvestment. The importance of this concentration limit is to avoid the risk of concentration of \\ninvestments in only one or few companies, while looking for short-term gains and returns. \\n \\nSEBI further notified that a Category III AIF can calculate its investment concentration based \\non either ‘Investable Funds’ or the ‘Net Asset Value’ (NAV) of the scheme, while investing in \\nlisted equity of an investee company. All Category III AIFs shall disclose the basis for \\ncalculation of investment concentration norm in the PPM document and shall not be changed \\nduring the tenure of the scheme.80 \\n \\nFor Category III AIFs calculating the investment concentration based on the Net Asset Value \\n(NAV) of the scheme, the following is specified:81 \\n• The limit for investment in listed equity shall be calculated based on the NAV of the \\nfund on the business day immediately preceding the date on which the Category III \\nAIF makes such investment. \\n• NAV of the AIF shall be the sum of value of all securities adjusted for mark to market \\ngains/losses, including cash and cash equivalents. The NAV shall exclude any funds \\nborrowed by Category III AIFs. \\n• Passive breach of concentration norms shall be rectified within 30 days from the date \\nof the breach. \\n \\nThe Investment Manager must ensure that appropriate risk management measures are \\nimplemented to avoid any breach of concentration limit. The concentration limit of 10 \\npercent is on the investable funds and not on total contributions from one investor. Hence, if \\nthe commitments of a Category III AIF are Rs. 100 crore and the first investment contribution \\nmade by an institutional investor is Rs. 10 crore, such contribution received could entirely be \\ninvested in one security, making it 10 percent of the fund corpus. However, such investment \\nmade by the Investment Manager would be highly risky from the point of view of the \\ninstitutional investor, and hence should be avoided as further capital contribution may or may \\nnot be made by the institutional investor in subsequent drawdowns.  \\n5.9 Category III AIFs: Open-ended v/s Close-ended \\n \\nAll Category III AIFs are either open-ended or close-ended, as structured by the Sponsor or \\nInvestment Manager, at the time of registration. In contrast to this, all Category I AIFs and \\nCategory II AIFs are compulsorily close-ended and the tenure of such funds is determined at \\nthe time of registration.  \\n                                                          \\n \\n79 Vide SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) (Fourth Amendment) Regulations, 2022 w.e.f.

Additional contribution made \\nby such investor, after the first investment in the Category III AIF, has no such limit. In case of \\npartial redemption of units by an investor, the open-ended Category III AIF shall ensure that \\nafter such redemption, the amount of investment retained by the investor in the fund does \\nnot fall below the minimum investment limit i.e. Rs. 1crore.82 \\n \\nIn a close-ended fund structure: \\n \\n• Investors make capital commitments, which are called by the Investment Manager by \\nmaking “Capital Calls” from investors, over a pre-defined period known as \\n“Commitment Period”.  \\n \\n• The Commitment Period is usually the first three years of the Fund Tenure.  \\n \\n• Redemption of capital is not permitted in a close-ended fund structure, prior to \\nwinding-up of the Fund.

Sponsor commitment in the Category III AIF, at the date of \\n                                                          \\n \\n84 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/AFD/PoD1/CIR/2023/96 dated June 21, 2023 on Issuance of units of AIFs in \\ndematerialized form. \\n85 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/AFD-1/PoD/P/CIR/2022/155 dated November 17, 2022 on Guidelines for AIFs for \\ndeclaration of first close, calculation of tenure and change of sponsor/manager or change in control of \\nsponsor/manager. \\n125 | P a g e  \\n \\ndeclaration of First Close shall not be reduced, withdrawn or transferred, after declaration of \\nFirst Close. \\n \\nExisting Category III AIFs who have not declared their First Close, shall declare their First Close \\nwithin 12 months from November 17, 2022 (i.e., the date of relevant SEBI Circular). However, \\nexisting Category III AIFs whose PPMs were taken on record by SEBI prior to 12 months from \\nNovember 17, 2022, and have not declared their First Close, shall submit an updated PPM \\nwith SEBI through a registered Merchant Banker along with due diligence certificate. Further, \\nthe updated PPM shall be circulated to the investors before declaration of First Close. \\n \\nFor Large Value Funds (LVFs), the First Close must be declared within 12 months from the \\ndate of grant of registration of the Category III AIF or date of filing of PPM of scheme with \\nSEBI, whichever is later. Existing LVFs shall declare their First Close within 12 months from \\nNovember 17, 2022.  \\n \\nIt is further clarified that if the First Close of a Category III AIF scheme is not declared within \\nthe timeline prescribed above, the Category III AIF shall file a fresh application for launch of \\nits schemes as per applicable provisions of SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations \\nby paying requisite fee to SEBI.  \\n \\nThe First Close is followed by a Final Close, and the period for final close is usually defined in \\nthe PPM which could be lower or higher than 1 year. Final close marks the end of the fund-\\nraising process for a specific Category III AIF/Scheme. The investors who want to allocate \\nfunds to this AIF scheme have access to more information, as compared to investors in the \\nfirst close, as they can analyse the performance of the scheme during the period between \\nfirst close and final close.  \\n \\nA close ended Category III AIF cannot accept more investors after the final close of the fund. \\nHowever, an open ended Category III AIF can accept money from the investors, at any time \\nafter the final close of the fund. \\n \\nUnlike Category I and II AIFs, all Category III AIFs do not have a minimum tenure of 3 years. \\nThe tenure for a close-ended Category III AIF is determined at the time of Registration with \\nSEBI and is computed from the date of declaration of the First Close. The Category III AIF may \\nmodify the tenure of a scheme at any time before declaration of its First Close. Prior to \\ndeclaration of the First Close, the investor may withdraw or reduce commitment provided to \\nthe Category III AIF scheme. \\n \\nExisting Category III AIF schemes which have declared their First Close before November 17, \\n2022, may continue to calculate their tenure from the date of Final Close. Such existing \\nschemes of Category III AIFs, which are yet to declare Final Close, shall declare their Final Close \\nas per the timeline provided in their respective PPMs and the fund shall not have any \\ndiscretion to extend the said timeline provided in the PPM. \\n \\nIn case of close-ended Category III AIFs, the tenure of the Fund can be extended up to an \\nadditional period of 2 years, with two individual extensions of 1-year each. Such extension of \\nfund tenure is subject to approval of two-thirds of the investors by value of their investment \\n126 | P a g e  \\n \\nin the Category III AIF. In absence of such consent from investors or upon expiry of the \\nextended tenure, the fund shall be wound up.86  \\n \\nFor example, Fund LMN is a close-ended Category III AIF with tenure of 5 years. It has filed \\nthe PPM document with SEBI on 1st June, 2023 and has received SEBI approval on September \\n15, 2023, for launching a close-ended scheme “LMN Growth Fund I” with Total Capital \\nCommitments of Rs. 300 crore. Fund LMN will need to declare first close on or before 31st \\nMay 2024, and tenure of 5 years would start from the day the First Close is declared.  \\nIf Fund LMN has declared its First Close on November 15, 2023, then 5 years will commence \\nfrom November 15, 2023 and the tenure will end on November 14, 2028. \\n \\nLet us assume that the Total Net Asset of the fund as on November 14, 2028, is Rs. 600 crore. \\nThe scheme is eligible for extension for two more years till November 14, 2030. For the \\nextension: \\n \\n• Investment Manager shall seek approval, before November 14, 2028, from the \\ninvestors. The approval can be sought for one year at a time and maximum of two \\nsuch extensions are allowed. First extension would be till November 14, 2029 and if \\nrequired, one more extension can be sought for another year ending November 14, \\n2030. \\n \\nApproval must be sought from investors having units worth at least Rs. 400 crore in \\nthe Fund.

Listing of close-\\nended funds/schemes on a recognized stock exchange is voluntary. \\n \\nIn order to get listed on a recognized stock exchange: \\n \\nI. \\nA Category III AIF must make an application to a recognized stock exchange for listing \\nof units of its close-ended scheme on the stock exchange platform, submit the \\nrequired documentation and pay the designated fees based on the size of the \\nFund/Scheme.  \\n \\nII. \\nBased on the documentation, the recognized stock exchange grants an in-principle \\napproval for listing of scheme units on the exchange platform. \\n \\nIII. \\nThe Category III AIF seeks approval from SEBI, for listing of units of its close-ended \\nscheme on the Stock Exchange platform. \\n \\nIV. \\nAfter receiving SEBI approval for listing of units, the recognized stock exchange can \\ngrant the final approval and list the units of the close-ended scheme for trading \\npurpose. \\n \\n \\n \\n129 | P a g e  \\n \\n5.15 Category III AIFs: Participation in Credit Default Swaps88 \\n \\nA Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a credit derivative contract in which one counterparty \\n(protection seller) commits to pay to the other counterparty (protection buyer) in the case of \\na credit event with respect to a reference entity and in return, the protection buyer makes \\nperiodic payments (premium) to the protection seller until the maturity of the contract or the \\ncredit event, whichever is earlier. The Reference Entity is an entity against whose credit risk, \\na credit derivative contract is entered into.89 \\n \\nCategory III AIFs may buy credit default swaps for the purpose of hedging or taking additional \\nexposure, subject to permissible leverage limits as discussed earlier. Similarly, Category III \\nAIFs may sell CDS subject to the condition that effective leverage undertaken at the scheme \\nlevel is within permissible leverage limits. Further, the total exposure to one investee \\ncompany, including the exposure through CDS, shall be within the concentration limits \\napplicable to Category III AIFs, as mentioned in the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) \\nRegulations. \\n \\nCategory III AIFs may sell CDS by earmarking unencumbered Government bonds/Treasury \\nbills equal to the amount of the said CDS exposure. Such earmarked securities may also be \\nused for maintaining applicable margin requirements for the said CDS exposure and shall not \\nbe considered to compute the leverage limit of the AIF scheme. \\n \\nCDS exposures taken by a Category III AIF shall be reported to the custodian by the next \\nworking day. The Custodian shall put in place a mechanism to collect necessary details from \\nCategory III AIFs transacting in CDS, to monitor the compliance with leverage limits and \\nconcentration limits applicable to such AIFs. In case of breach of leverage limits due to \\ntransactions in CDS by Category III AIFs, the reporting obligation and necessary actions vest \\non the manager/AIF and the Custodian.90  \\n \\nIf a Category III AIF sells CDS by earmarking securities and in case the amount of earmarked \\nsecurities falls below the CDS exposure, then: \\n• The Category III AIF shall send a report to the custodian on the same day of the breach. \\n• The Category III AIF shall bring the amount of earmarked securities equal to CDS \\nexposure and report details regarding rectification of breach to custodian, by the end \\nof next trading day.  \\n• In case the Category III AIF fails to rectify the breach in the manner as specified above, \\nthe custodian shall report details of the breach to SEBI, on the next working day.  \\n \\nIf a Category III AIF takes an unhedged position in a CDS, then the Category III AIF should \\nensure that the gross unhedged positions are up to 25 percent of investable funds of the \\n                                                          \\n \\n88 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/AFD/PoD/CIR/2023/15 dated January 12, 2023 on Participation of AIFs in Credit \\nDefault Swaps. \\n89 Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Credit Derivatives) Directions, 2022 w.e.f.

This reporting \\nframework in known as Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and India is a signatory to \\nexchange information under the CRS, from June 3, 2015. \\nFor effective implementation and exchange of information as per requirements of FATCA \\nand CRS, the Income Tax Act, 1961 was amended to notify rules 114F to 114H under the \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962 and the CBDT issued guidance notes for FATCA and CRS compliance \\nand implementation. \\nAs per the FATCA and CRS compliance requirements, every entity is required to ascertain its \\nstatus, whether as a Financial Institution or a Non-Financial Entity (NFE). If an entity is a \\nfinancial institution, it should be examined as to whether such an institution constitutes a \\nreporting financial institution (RFI) or a non-reporting financial institution. A non-reporting \\nfinancial institution is not required to register with the IRS and report financial accounts. A \\nReporting Financial Institution (RFI) is an Indian Financial Institution which agrees to obtain \\nand exchange information, under the provisions of the Inter-Government Agreement \\nbetween India and the United States. \\n147 | P a g e  \\n \\nAs per the provisions of FATCA and CRS, financial institutions including Category III AIFs have \\nbeen given additional due diligence requirements related to investor accounts, under Rules \\n114F to 114H of the Income Tax Rules, 1962. Category III AIFs should register with the US IRS \\nand obtain a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN) and also register with the \\nIndian Income Tax authorities for reporting personal tax and beneficial owner information \\nof all investors, self-declarations, and documentation received from all investors, such as: \\n• Name \\n• Address \\n• Place (city/state) of birth \\n• Country of birth \\n• Nationality \\n• Gross Annual Income \\n• Occupation \\n• Permanent Account Number (PAN) \\n• Whether resident of another country? If yes, then the country of residence and Tax \\nIdentification Number (TIN) \\n• Social Security Number (SSN), if applicable \\nFrom January 2016, it is mandatory for all Indian and NRI investors in the Category III AIF to \\nfile a FATCA self-declaration. FATCA reporting would be required for investors identified as \\n‘U.S. persons’, while CRS reporting is required for foreign investors from other countries in \\nthe world, investing in the Category III AIF. \\nIf the Fund has U.S. Investors or beneficial ownership of a U.S. registered entity, information \\nwill have to be reported by the Category III AIF to tax authorities. A Category III AIF is a \\ndeemed financial institution and hence the investors will be required to comply with the \\ninformation request of the Fund to furnish any information, documents or declarations, as \\nand when deemed necessary. In case any investor fails to furnish such information sought, \\nthe fund reserves the right to reject the application or redeem the existing units of the \\nconcerned investor, in addition to reporting the investor to the regulatory authority. \\nFATCA and CRS provisions are relevant not only at on-boarding stage of the investors but \\nalso throughout the life-cycle of investment with the Fund. Investors, therefore, should \\nintimate to the Fund or the Investment Manager, any change in the FATCA and CRS related \\ninformation submitted previously, within 30 days from the date of knowledge of such \\nchange. The onus to provide accurate, adequate and timely inputs in this regard would be \\non the concerned investor. \\n5.20 SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 \\n \\nThe SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 seeks to prevent insider trading \\nwhich erodes the confidence of the common investors in the securities markets. SEBI \\n148 | P a g e  \\n \\n(Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations is applicable to all listed companies, \\nintermediaries and fiduciaries to the company. \\nAs per the Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) Regulations, “insider” has been defined as any \\nperson who is: (i) a connected person, or (ii) in possession of or having access to unpublished \\nprice sensitive information.112 A “connected person”, in terms of the PIT Regulations, means \\nany person, who is or has during the 6 months prior to a concerned transaction, directly or \\nindirectly, \\n• been associated with the listed company, by reason of frequent communication with \\nits officers; or \\n• being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship; or \\n• being a director, officer or an employee of the company; or \\n• holds any position including a professional or business relationship, whether \\ntemporary or permanent, allowing access to unpublished price sensitive information. \\nCategory III AIF can, therefore, be ‘deemed to be a connected person’, as specified in the PIT \\nRegulations, on account of the fund having possible access to unpublished price sensitive \\ninformation about any investee company or class of companies. \\nThe PIT Regulations stipulates that no insider shall communicate, provide or allow access to \\nunpublished price sensitive information, except in furtherance of business purposes, \\nperformance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. Unpublished price sensitive \\ninformation is any information relating to a company or its securities, directly or indirectly, \\nthat is not generally available and which upon becoming generally available is likely to \\nmaterially affect the price of the securities.113 Such unpublished information includes:  \\n• \\nfinancial results \\n• \\ndividends \\n• \\nchange in capital structure \\n• \\nmergers, de-mergers, acquisitions, delisting, disposals and expansion of business  \\n• \\nchanges in key managerial personnel \\n \\nAs the employees of the Category III AIF can invest in AIF schemes, with a minimum \\ninvestment of Rs. 25 lakh, such employees may possess unpublished price sensitive \\ninformation. The Board of Directors of such Category III AIFs must set an Internal Code of \\nConduct governing trading by their employees and other connected persons to ensure \\ncompliance under the PIT Regulations.  \\n                                                          \\n \\n112Unpublished price sensitive information is any information relating to a company or its securities, directly or \\nindirectly, that is not generally available to the public and which upon becoming generally available, is likely to \\nmaterially affect the price of the securities. \\n113 Generally available information” means any information that is accessible to the public on a non-\\ndiscriminatory basis. \\n149 | P a g e  \\n \\nInsider shall not trade in securities that are listed or proposed to be listed on a stock \\nexchange when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. Exception to this \\nregulation is when the transaction is: \\n• \\nan off-market inter-se transfer between insiders along with timely disclosure to \\nthe company; \\n• \\ndone through block deal window mechanism; \\n• \\ncarried out pursuant to regulatory obligations; \\n• \\nundertaken pursuant to exercise of stock options \\n• \\ndone by non-individual insiders, such as Institutions wherein: \\no \\nthe individuals in possession of unpublished price sensitive information \\nwere different from individuals taking trading decisions \\no \\nappropriate and adequate arrangements were in place to ensure that no \\nunpublished price sensitive information was communicated by \\nindividuals possessing the information to the individuals taking trading \\ndecisions  \\n• \\ndone pursuant to a Trading Plan set up in accordance with the PIT Regulations. \\nSuch trading plan should be presented to the Compliance Officer for approval and \\nadequate public disclosure must be made.  \\nThe Board of Directors or head(s) of organisation (in this context: Investment Manager or \\nSponsor of the Category III AIF), in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, shall \\nensure that a structured digital database is maintained internally, which contains:114 \\n• \\nthe nature of unpublished price sensitive information shared \\n• \\nthe names of such persons who have shared the information  \\n• \\nthe names of such persons with whom the information is shared along with their \\nPermanent Account Number (PAN) or any other identifier authorized by law \\nwhere PAN is not available.  \\nSuch database shall not be outsourced and shall be maintained internally, with adequate \\ninternal controls and checks such as time stamping and audit trails to ensure non-tampering. \\nThe database shall be preserved for a period of not less than 8 years after completion of the \\nrelevant transactions, or till the completion of SEBI proceedings in respect of such \\ntransactions, if any. \\nThe Compliance Officer and Directors of the Category III AIF should be responsible to frame a \\n‘Code of Conduct’, which details out the policies and procedures to be followed by such fund \\nin order to deal with price sensitive information and reporting of transactions done by \\n’connected person’, ’deemed to be connected person’ and immediate relatives of such \\npersons. The Code of Conduct shall be applicable to Promoters, Directors, Chief Executive \\n                                                          \\n \\n114 Vide SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2020 w.e.f. July 17, 2020. \\n150 | P a g e  \\n \\nOfficer (CEO), employees up to two levels below the CEO, support staff, material subsidiaries \\nand affiliate companies of Category III AIF, such as the Asset Management Company, Sponsor \\nand Trustee Company. \\nThe PIT Regulations have set forth minimum standards for the Code of Conduct, to regulate, \\nmonitor and report trading by designated persons, and their immediate relatives, of a \\nCategory III AIF (a SEBI registered intermediary). All information shall be handled within the \\nfund on a need-to-know basis and no unpublished price sensitive information shall be \\ncommunicated to any person, except in furtherance of legitimate purposes. The Code of \\nConduct shall contain norms for Chinese Wall procedures and shall stipulate sanctions and \\ndisciplinary actions, including wage freeze, suspension, recovery, etc., that may be imposed, \\nby the Category IIIAIF, in case of non-compliance. In the event of any violation of the PIT \\nRegulations, profits derived out of such trades should be collected and credited to the \\nInvestor Protection and Education Fund, established by SEBI. \\nThe Code of Conduct should stipulate a reporting format for making pre-clearance \\napplications, reporting of trades executed and level of holdings in securities. Designated \\npersons of the Category III AIF, and their immediate relatives, shall not trade in securities \\nwhen the trading window is closed. Trading by designated persons shall be subject to pre-\\nclearance by the Compliance Officer of the Category III AIF, if the value is above the pre-\\ndetermined threshold limit. Pre-cleared trades should be executed within 7 trading days of \\napproval, failing which fresh pre-clearance is required. \\nEvery Category III AIF should implement an institutional mechanism for prevention of insider \\ntrading. The fund should build an adequate and effective internal control system, to ensure \\ncompliance with the requirements given under the PIT Regulations: \\n• All employees who have access to unpublished price sensitive information should be \\nidentified as designated persons. \\n• All price sensitive information shall be identified and its confidentiality shall be \\nmaintained. \\n• Adequate restrictions shall be placed on communication or procurement of \\nunpublished price sensitive information. \\n• Lists of all employees and other persons with whom unpublished price sensitive \\ninformation is shared shall be maintained and confidentiality agreements shall be \\nsigned, or notice shall be served, to all such employees and persons. \\n• Conduct periodic process reviews, to evaluate effectiveness of internal controls.  \\n• Formulate written policies and procedures for inquiry in case of leak or suspected leak \\nof unpublished price sensitive information. \\n• Frame a whistle-blower policy and all the employees should be made aware of such \\npolicy. \\n \\n151 | P a g e  \\n \\n5.21 Prevention of Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2002 \\n \\nIndia is a full-fledged member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international \\nwatchdog for money laundering. Member nations are required to pass domestic laws to \\nprevent money laundering and perform an oversight function. In pursuance of international \\ncommitments, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) was enacted to prevent the \\ngeneration of black money and proceeds from criminal activities. PMLA states that whosoever \\ndirectly or indirectly attempts to indulge, or knowingly assists, or knowingly is a party, or is \\nactually involved in any process or activity connected to proceeds of crime, including its \\nconcealment, possession, acquisition or use, and projecting or claiming it as untainted \\nproperty shall be guilty of the offence of money-laundering. In other words, money \\nlaundering is the process of conversion of money obtained from criminal activity into \\napparently legitimate money by concealing its criminal origin. The main objective of the PMLA \\nis, therefore, to prevent and control activities concerning money laundering and to confiscate \\nproperty derived from or involved in money laundering. \\n \\nGeneration of black money through cash transactions and funnelling it into bank accounts, \\nthrough layering with a series of fictitious transactions using shell companies, is a very good \\nexample of money laundering in the domestic economy. Money laundering through cross \\nborder route is also possible through the process of round tripping, ‘hawala’ transactions, \\netc., and routing the funds through bank accounts in tax havens, held by private trusts and \\nother concealed entities. Money laundering is a serious economic offence as it undermines \\nthe integrity of the market participants, distorts economic performance, mis-allocates capital \\nflows, evades taxes and finances criminal and terrorist activities. \\n \\nRegulatory Oversight: \\n \\nThe PML Rules requires the reporting entities i.e. banks, financial institutions and \\nintermediaries, such as Category III AIFs to maintain records of the following transactions: \\n• \\nAll cash transactions of the value of more than Rs. 10 lakh, or its equivalent in \\nforeign currency. \\n• \\nAll series of cash transactions, integrally connected to each other and individually \\nvalued below Rs. 10 lakh, or its equivalent in foreign currency, but have taken \\nplace within a month and the monthly aggregate exceeds the threshold of Rs. 10 \\nlakh or equivalent in foreign currency. \\n• \\nAll transactions involving receipts by a non-profit organization (NPO) of value \\nmore than Rs. 10 lakh or its equivalent in foreign currency. \\n• \\nAll cross-border wire transfers of a value of more than Rs. 5 lakh or its equivalent \\nin foreign currency, where either the origin or destination of fund is in India. \\n• \\nAll cash transactions where forged or counterfeit currency notes or bank notes are \\nused as genuine notes. \\n152 | P a g e  \\n \\n• \\nAll suspicious transactions whether or not made in cash and including, inter-alia, \\ncredits or debits into from any non-monetary account such as demat accounts, \\netc. \\nThe transactions must be recorded in such manner as to enable the relevant institution to \\nreconstruct individual transactions.  \\nFinancial institutions, including Category III AIFs, perform client due diligence, as per the \\nPrevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules.  \\nThe Category III AIF must, at the time of commencement of the client-relationship: \\n• \\nverify and maintain the records of identity of their clients  \\n• \\nobtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship \\n• \\ndetermine whether a client is acting on behalf of a beneficial owner and thereby \\nidentify and verify the identity of such beneficial owner, if any \\n• \\nevaluate the risks associated with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and implement \\nnecessary measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing \\nEvery Category III AIF has to be registered with Central KYC Records (CKYCR) Registry, by \\nfiling an application with requisite documents and details of the Sponsors, Investment \\nManager, Compliance Officer, two authorised administrative staffs for online filing of \\ndocuments and performing maker-checker control. \\nThe Category III AIF should upload the KYC information of customers, in the KYC template \\nprovided on CKYCR portal along with scanned copy of Proof of Address (PoA) and Proof of \\nIdentity (PoI) after successful verification. After uploading such information, the KYC \\nIdentifier issued by the CKYCR portal must be communicated to the respective investors. If \\na new investor has an existing KYC Identifier, the Category III AIF should download the KYC \\ninformation from the CKYCR portal and use such information only for the purpose of identity \\nverification. In case of any change in the KYC information of its investors, the Category III AIF \\nmust update the same on the CKYCR portal. Further, Category III AIFs are permitted to share KYC \\ndata with customer consent, provided it is done securely and in compliance with data protection \\nlaws. \\nIf the Category III AIF has Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), the fund should adopt the risk-\\nbased KYC framework, applicable to such investors. The Category III AIF should upload the \\nKYC documents on the KYC Registration Agency (KRA) portal for other market intermediaries \\nor funds to access and complete their KYC requirements. Identification of Ultimate Beneficial \\nOwners (UBOs) is imperative for the fund, to establish the natural person who ultimately \\nowns or controls the institution which is investing in the Category III AIF. The Ultimate \\nBeneficial Owners, structured as a company or a trust, should be identified on controlling \\nownership interest (also termed as ‘ownership or entitlement’) and control basis, which is \\n25 percent as per the PMLA Rules. The Ultimate Beneficial Owners, structured as a \\n153 | P a g e  \\n \\npartnership firm or an unincorporated association of individuals, should be identified on \\nownership or entitlement basis, which is 15 percent as per the PMLA Rules.  \\nCustodians should maintain the KYC records in original for a minimum period of 5 years from \\nthe date of cessation of the transactions with the FPIs investing in the Category III AIF. In \\ncase any litigation is pending, these records should be maintained till the completion of the \\nproceedings. \\nFurther, a Category III AIF must ensure that appropriate steps are taken to recognize and \\nreport suspicious transactions to the Director – Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) - India.115 An \\nillustrative list of suspicious transactions is given below: \\n• \\nClients whose identity verification seems difficult or clients that appear not to \\ncooperate \\n• \\nAsset management services for clients where the source of the funds is not clear \\nor not in keeping with clients’ apparent standing /business activity; \\n• \\nClients based in high risk jurisdictions; \\n• \\nSubstantial increases in business without apparent cause; \\n• \\nClients transferring large sums of money to or from overseas locations with \\ninstructions for payment in cash; \\n• \\nAttempted transfer of investment proceeds to apparently unrelated third parties; \\n• \\nUnusual transactions by businesses undertaken by offshore banks/financial \\nservices, businesses reported to be in the nature of export-import of small items. \\nAny suspicious transaction shall be immediately notified to the Money Laundering Control \\nOfficer or a designated officer with the Category III AIF. Category III AIFs are also directed to \\ntake counter measures against clients based in high risk jurisdictions, including countries \\nwhere existence and effectiveness of money laundering controls is suspected or which do \\nnot or insufficiently apply FATF standards. These measures may include a further enhanced \\nscrutiny of transactions, enhanced and systematic reporting mechanisms for financial \\ntransactions and applying enhanced due diligence while expanding business relationships \\nwith such clients. \\nSome Category III AIFs may receive capital commitments from family trusts, foundations or \\ntrusts and entities which may be formed as a society under the Societies Registration Act, \\n1860 or a company registered under section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. Such transactions \\nhave to be reported and KYC has to be done on the non-profit organisations (NPOs), as \\ndiscussed above. Further, family trusts are not required to be registered under the \\nRegistration Act. Such a family trust would not be regarded as a registered trust and, hence, \\n                                                          \\n \\n115 Vide SEBI Master Circular No.: SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2019/113 dated October 15, 2019 on Guidelines \\non Anti Money Laundering (AML) Standards and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/ Obligation of \\nSecurities Market Intermediaries under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and Rules framed \\nthereunder. \\n154 | P a g e  \\n \\nnot fall within the definition of NPO, under PML Rules. A family trust on the other hand is set \\nup with the objective of maintenance and creation of wealth for the ultimate benefit of \\nbeneficiaries of the family creating such trust. Therefore, investments received by a Category \\nIII AIF, from a family trust, would not be covered under the PML Rules pertaining to \\ntransactions undertaken by NPOs, and as such are not required to be reported, unless they \\nget covered in any other category such as suspicious transactions. \\nThe Director-FIU, India has been permitted to make provisional attachment of property for \\na period not exceeding 180 days if there is reason to believe that the person is in possession \\nof any proceeds of crime. The Finance Act 2015 introduced certain amendments to the PMLA \\nand expanded the definition of ‘proceeds of crime’ to include those which are taken out of \\nthe country as well. \\n \\n5.22 Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 \\n \\nForeign investment in India is primarily governed by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, \\n1999 (FEMA) and the regulations framed thereunder, which consolidate the law relating to \\nforeign exchange in India. On November 7, 2017, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued \\nthe Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident \\noutside India) Regulations, 2017 (TISPRO Regulations), which stand superseded by the \\nForeign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, notified by the Central \\nGovernment and the Foreign Exchange Management (Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2019, \\nnotified by RBI. Pursuant to these amendments to FEMA, the Central Government, instead \\nof the RBI, has been granted the power of specifying all permissible capital account \\ntransactions in non-debt instruments and the RBI has been granted the power of specifying \\nall permissible capital account transactions in debt instruments. \\nThe following instruments are now considered as ‘non-debt instruments’, inter alia, \\nincluding: \\n• All investments in equity instruments of incorporated entities (whether public, \\nprivate, listed and unlisted); \\n• Capital participation in limited liability partnerships (LLPs);  \\n• All instruments of investment as recognised in the FDI Policy as notified from time to \\ntime; \\n• Investment in units of Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), Real Estate Investment \\nTrusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs);  \\n• Investment in units of Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that invest \\nmore than 50 per cent in equity; \\n• The junior-most layer (i.e. equity tranche) of a securitization structure; \\n• Acquisition, sale or dealing directly in immovable property; \\n155 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Contribution to trusts; \\n• Depository receipts issued against equity instruments. \\nThe following instruments are now considered as ‘debt instruments’, inter alia, including: \\n• Government bonds; \\n• Corporate bonds; \\n• All tranches of securitization structure which are not equity tranche; \\n• Borrowings by Indian firms through loans; \\n• Depository receipts whose underlying securities are debt securities. \\nThe Indian FDI Policy allows foreign investment in Indian Companies through: \\n• Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) \\n• Investments made by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) \\n• Investments made by Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCI) \\n• Investments in investment vehicles, such as a Category III AIF \\nForeign investors may make purchase or redemption of units issued by an Indian Category III \\nAIF, either under the Automatic Route or under the Approval Route. The Automatic Route \\nentails investing without the requirement of a prior approval from regulatory authorities such \\nas the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), RBI and other \\nconcerned departments of the Government of India. The Automatic Route is unavailable for \\ninvestments in some sectors and for investments above established thresholds in some \\nsectors. When the Automatic Route is unavailable, the foreign investor must obtain prior \\npermission from the sector-specific competent authorities, known as the Approval Route. In \\ncase of doubt as to which competent authority is to be approached, the DPIIT is mandated to \\nidentify the competent authority concerned and hence, the DPIIT has established a Foreign \\nInvestment Facilitation Portal (FIFP). \\nA Foreign Investor investing in a Category III AIF, having “Unified Structure” of investments, \\ndoes not need to obtain prior approval from Government Authorities and can invest directly \\nunder the Automatic Route. Investment Managers of Category III AIFs can set up foreign \\nmanagers or funds under the automatic route, subject to approvals from the financial services \\nregulator in India as well as the regulator in the jurisdiction in which the investment is \\nintended to be made. \\nWith effect from April 1, 2020, for an Indian company engaged in a sector where FDI is not \\nprohibited, the default aggregate FPI limits is the applicable sectoral cap as laid out in \\nSchedule I of the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019. A \\nsectoral cap is the maximum limit of permissible investment by foreign investors, in one \\nindustry sector. As per the erstwhile TISPRO Regulations, these FPI limits were capped at 24 \\npercent, with the investee company having an option to enhance the FPI limits to the \\napplicable sectoral cap. In sectors where FDI is prohibited, the aggregate FPI limit is capped \\n156 | P a g e  \\n \\nat 24 percent of the company\\'s paid-up equity capital on a fully diluted basis. In case the FPI \\ninvestor has breached the FPI ceiling limit, such investor will have 5 trading days, from the \\ndate of settlement of the trades, to divest its holdings in the company. \\nA Category III AIF which has received foreign investment, or made foreign investment \\nabroad, in any previous year or the current financial year, shall file an annual return on the \\nForeign Liabilities and Assets (FLA), by 15th July of every year, using the Foreign Liabilities \\nand Assets Information Reporting (FLAIR) portal launched by RBI. Furthermore, a Category \\nIII AIF with existing direct or indirect foreign investment is required to provide information \\nto the RBI in the Single Master Form (SMF), through the Foreign Investment Reporting and \\nManagement System (FIRMS) portal. All Indian entities, including Category III AIFs are \\nmandatorily required to file the SMF from September 1, 2018. With the new SMF manual \\nand FIRMS framework, all filings will need to be completed by the Category III AIF, and \\nverified, scrutinized and acknowledged or rejected by their respective Authorized Dealer \\n(AD) Banks. \\nAll income earned by foreign investors by investing through the Automatic Route, including \\nincome based on dividends, interest and sales of units, must be routed through an \\nauthorized dealer before being repatriated back to the home country. \\nSome important reforms for foreign investment in a Category III AIF are as under: \\n• Applicability of Downstream Investment conditions:  \\nDownstream Investment is an investment made by an Indian Investment Vehicle in a \\ndomestic company, where more than 51 percent investors in the Indian Investment Vehicle \\nare foreign investors. Generally and ordinarily, such investments made by the Investment \\nVehicle are considered to be “Indirect Foreign Investments” and are subject to the FDI \\nrestrictions therein. \\nIn order to boost foreign investments in India and in domestic AIFS, the RBI passed certain \\ngovernment reforms for easier investments in an AIF. As per RBI Notification No: FEMA \\n355/2015-RB dated November 16, 2015, a downstream Investment made by a Category III \\nAIF shall be regarded as an indirect foreign investment only if, either the sponsor or the \\ninvestment manager of the Category III AIF is not Indian ‘owned and controlled’.116 ‘Control’ \\nof the AIF should be in the hands of the sponsor or investment manager of the Category III \\nAIF for the investment to be termed as an indirect foreign investment. “Owned and \\nControlled” does not take only the extent of foreign investment in the corpus of the Category \\nIII AIF, to determine as to whether downstream investment of the Category III AIF is an \\nindirect foreign investment or not.  \\n                                                          \\n \\n116 defined in Foreign Exchange Management (Manner of Receipt and Payment) (Amendment) Regulations, \\n2019 \\n157 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe RBI Notification allows a Foreign Investor to invest in an Indian Category III AIF and not \\ncomply with the FDI restrictions, if the Sponsor can justify that the “Control” of the fund is \\nin the hands of either the sponsor or the investment manager. With such relaxation of norms \\nand FDI restrictions for foreign investors looking to invest in Indian Category III AIFs, the \\nIndian Alternative Investment Market has seen an unprecedented growth in size. The \\npayment for the units of a Category III AIF must be made by a debit to Foreign Currency Non-\\nResident (FCNR) or Non-Resident External (“NRE”) or Special Non-Resident Rupee (SNRR) \\naccount maintained by a person resident outside India (the overseas buyer) with an \\nAuthorised Dealer or an Authorised Bank in India.117 A Category III AIF which is “owned and \\ncontrolled” by a non-Indian sponsor or investment manager, downstream Investments \\nmade by such Category III AIF must comply with the sectoral caps, as applicable to the \\nsectors in which the downstream investment is made as per the FDI Policy. \\nAny Indian entity or investment vehicle making downstream investment in another Indian \\nentity shall be considered as indirect foreign investment and shall file Form DI with the RBI \\nwithin 30 days from the date of allotment of the equity instruments.118 \\n \\n• Overseas Investment by a Category III AIF registered with SEBI: \\nAll AIFs, including Category III AIFs can invest in securities issued by companies incorporated \\noutside India, with the following conditions: \\no Investments in equity or equity-linked securities issued by offshore \\ncompanies are subject to a maximum limit of USD 1500 million across all \\nregistered AIFs. Allocation of this limit will be done on first-come-first served \\nbasis. An Offshore Company is a foreign company whose shares are not listed \\non an Indian Stock Exchange.119 \\no A Category III AIF desirous of making such offshore investments shall submit \\na proposal to SEBI for approval. SEBI will grant separate overseas investment \\nlimits to the applicable AIFs.  \\no A Category III AIF shall report the utilization of such overseas investment \\nlimits within 5 working days. The fund should also inform SEBI if such \\ninvestment limits was unused or partially used in a financial year or if the Fund \\nwishes to stop making overseas investments. \\n \\no Overseas Investment shall not exceed 25 percent of the Investible Funds of \\nthe Category III AIF or its scheme. \\n                                                          \\n \\n117specified in Foreign Exchange Management (Deposits) Regulations, 2016 \\n118 As per Foreign Exchange Management (Mode of Payment and Reporting of Non-Debt Instruments) \\nRegulations, 2019 \\n119 Vide SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/IMD/DF6/CIR/P/2021/565 on “Enhancement of overall limit for overseas \\ninvestment by Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)/Venture Capital Funds (VCFs)” \\n158 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\nFurther, SEBI has notified the guidelines for overseas investment by all AIFs.

In addition, SEBI stringently regulates all offers for sale, further \\nissuances and rights issues by listed companies, except when the value of such shares does \\nnot exceed Rs. 50 crore. ICDR Regulations have different impacts for a Category III AIF looking \\nto make an investment in a company through an IPO, or exit from an investee company \\nthrough an IPO. \\n• Pricing of securities issued in IPO: \\nAn unlisted company that is eligible to issue shares or stock may freely price its shares or any \\nsecurities convertible at a later date into equity shares as part of its IPO. \\n• Lock-in restriction in case of securities issued in IPO: \\nThe ICDR Regulations require timely disclosure of the aggregate shareholding of the \\npromoter’s group as well as the details of “inter-se” transfer of securities amongst the \\npromoters. A promoter or promoter group shall have a minimum shareholding of 20 percent \\nof the post-issue paid-up share capital of the company. Such contribution is locked-in from \\nthe date of allotment in the proposed public issue and cannot be disposed-off until 18 \\nmonths from the date of allotment of shares. In case the IPO involves fresh issue of equity \\nshares and the majority of the proceeds from such fresh issue is proposed to be utilised for \\ncapital expenditure, then the lock-in period for minimum promoter contribution shall be 3 \\nyears.120 However, inter-se transfer of promoter holdings is possible as long as the lock-in \\non such securities shall continue for the remaining period with the transferee and such \\ntransferee shall not be eligible to transfer the securities till the lock-in period of 3 years has \\nexpired.121 A Category III AIF is not deemed to be a promoter or to form part of the promoter \\n                                                          \\n \\n120 As per Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) (Third \\nAmendment) Regulations, 2021 \\n121 Regulation 22 of the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 \\n159 | P a g e  \\n \\ngroup, only by virtue of their equity holding of 20 percent in the company, unless it satisfies \\nother requirements prescribed in ICDR Regulations. \\nFurther, the entire pre-issue share capital of an unlisted company (other than the minimum \\npromoter contribution) is locked in for a period of 6 months from the date of allotment in \\nthe public issue. In case the IPO involves fresh issue of equity shares and the majority of the \\nproceeds from such fresh issue is proposed to be utilised for capital expenditure, then the \\nlock-in period for such shares shall be 1 year. A Category III AIF holding shares in the unlisted \\ncompany, will be subject to this 6-month lock-in period or the 1-year lock-in period, as the \\ncase may be, from the date of the allotment of shares. \\n• Preferential Allotment of Shares in a QIP: \\nA Category III AIF may invest by participating in a private placement of securities by the issuer \\nor in a Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP). Through a QIP, a listed company can make \\npreferential issue of securities to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) on a private placement \\nbasis. QIBs include sophisticated investors such as Mutual Funds, Alternative Investment \\nFunds, Commercial Banks and other Financial Institutions. \\n \\n• Lock-in Restriction in case of Preferential Allotment: \\nSecurities issued to investors such as a Category III AIF, in a preferential allotment shall be \\nsubject to a lock-in for a period of 6 months from the date of allotment of shares. In case \\nmajority of the proceeds from such preferential allotment is proposed to be utilised for \\ncapital expenditure, then the lock-in period for such shares shall be 1 year  \\n• Sale of Shares by a Category III AIF, in an Offer for Sale (OFS): \\nExisting shareholders are permitted to exit from companies through an “offer for sale” of \\ntheir holdings to the public, after receiving necessary approvals from the board, \\nshareholders and the stock exchanges. As per the ICDR Regulations, only those equity shares \\nwhich are held by the “Offeror”, or seller, for a period of at least 6 months at the time of \\nfiling the draft offer document with the SEBI can be offered to the public through an “offer \\nfor sale.” In case of an Offer for Sale of equity shares, where the majority of the proceeds \\nfrom such fresh issue is proposed to be utilised for capital expenditure, then the lock-in \\nperiod for such shares shall be 1 year.122 Hence, a Category III AIF must ensure that their exit \\nstrategy from an investee company takes into consideration various lock-in conditions. A \\nCategory III AIF having an intention to sell shares in an OFS is permitted to give notice of its \\nintention to sell the shares latest by 5 pm on T-1 day, T being the day of the OFS. \\n                                                          \\n \\n122 As per Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) (Third \\nAmendment) Regulations, 2021 \\n160 | P a g e  \\n \\nSEBI made it mandatory for the offeror, i.e. the Category III AIF, to give an option to retail \\ninvestors to place their bid at a cut-off price, in addition to placing price bids for securities. \\nCut-off price shall be determined based on the bids received on T-day. On T-day, only non-\\nretail investors shall be permitted to place their bids, whereas retail investors shall bid on T + \\n1 day.

As discussed in Unit 4, a Category III AIF appoints an \\nInvestment Manager, who provides fund management services using their investment \\nknowledge, market experience and industry exposure, with an aim to generate profits for the \\nfund. In return of such services, the Manager charges an investment management fee to the \\nCategory III AIF, known as Management Fees. Management Fees are allocated to every \\ninvestor on a pro-rata basis, based on their value of investment in the fund.  \\n \\nManagement Fees are charged as a fixed percentage, ranging from 1 percent to 2.5 percent, \\nof the Gross Net Asset Value of the fund. The rates at which the fees are charged are pre-\\ndetermined and fixed before the launch of the scheme and mentioned in the placement \\nmemorandum.   \\n \\nIt is important to note that: \\n• Management Fee is paid to the Manager, irrespective of any future gains or losses \\nmade by the Fund. Management Fees are paid for the fund management services \\nprovided by the Manager and not for profit-generation. The Management Fees shall \\naccrue from the date of the First Close, up to the date when the Category III AIF is \\ndissolved. \\n• Management Fees are to be paid on a periodic basis, generally monthly or quarterly, \\nas specified in the private placement memorandum issued by the fund. Management \\nFees are generally paid in arrears, within 14 days after the relevant valuation day, \\nwhen the Gross Net Asset Value (GNAV) of the Category III AIF is computed. \\n \\nExample 1: Computation of Management Fees: \\n \\nCategory III AIF - Fund ABC is launched on January 01, 2019. Following are the details of the \\nFund: \\nTotal Capital Contributions \\nRs. 50 crore \\n163 | P a g e  \\n \\nGross NAV - at end of Year 1 \\nRs. 58 crore \\nGross NAV - at end of Year 2 \\nRs. 65 crore \\nManagement Fees (excl. GST @ 18%) \\n1.5% \\n \\nCalculate the Management Fees payable by the Fund, in Year 1 and Year 2.  \\n \\nSolution:  \\n \\nManagement Fees in Year 1: \\n \\nGross NAV of the Fund at end of Year 1 – Rs. 58 crore (given) \\n \\nManagement Fees: \\n1.5% * Rs. 58 crore \\nRs. 87 lakhs \\nAdd: GST – 18% * Rs. 87 lakhs    \\nRs. 15.66 lakhs \\nTotal Management Fees Payable \\nRs.102.66 lakhs \\n \\nManagement Fees in Year 2: \\n \\nGross NAV of the Fund at end of Year 2 – Rs. 65 crore (given) \\n \\nManagement Fees: \\n1.5% * Rs. 65 crore \\nRs. 97.50 lakhs \\nAdd: GST – 18% * Rs. 97.50 lakhs    \\nRs. 17.55 lakhs \\nTotal Management Fees Payable \\nRs. 115.05 lakhs \\n \\nNote: \\n• Management Fees are not charged on the Committed Capital and Capital \\nContributions of the Fund. Management fees are computed on the GNAV of the fund, \\nas shown in the example. \\n \\nApart from Management Fees, the Manager is also eligible for a share in the profits earned \\nby the Category III AIF, on account of the investment management services provided by the \\nManager. If the Category III AIF earns a profit in any particular year, the Manager is entitled \\nto a fee for profit-sharing, known as Incentive Fees or Performance Fees. \\n \\nIncentive Fee is charged as a percentage of the incremental return earned by the Category III \\nAIF, generally between 0 and 20 percent, and is computed in accordance with the fee \\nstructure and computation methodology mentioned in the PPM. Such Incentive fees are an \\nadditional cost for the investors in the Fund and are allocated on a pro-rata basis to all \\ninvestors, based on their value of investment in the fund. \\n164 | P a g e  \\n \\nFurther, it is important to note that: \\n• Incentive fees are paid as an incentive to the Manager to generate profits for the fund. \\nThis helps to align the interest of the Manager with the interest of the fund and \\nencourages the Manager to seek best execution of investments for the interest of the \\ninvestors in the fund.  \\n \\n• Incentive Fees are computed and payable to Manager, after completion of the stated \\nfund tenure, in case of closed-ended funds.  \\n \\nFor the purpose of computing Incentive fees, it is important to understand the methodology \\nfor computing “Profits” or “Incremental Return”. For this purpose, let us understand the \\nconcepts of Hurdle Rate and High-Water Mark in the subsequent sections, before \\nunderstanding the Computation of Incentive Fees. \\n \\nTotal Fees charged by the Fund primarily includes Management Fees and Performance Fees. \\nHowever, due to the complex structure of the Category III AIF and day-to-day operations of \\nthe Fund, the Fund incurs the following additional expenses or fees which are indirectly borne \\nby the investors:  \\n \\n• Set-up Costs: \\n \\nThe Manager will charge one-time Set-up Costs from the unit-holders as a percentage of their \\ntotal capital commitments, which can go up to 2 percent or 2.5 percent of total capital \\ncommitments raised by the fund. The Set-up costs are incurred towards any offering costs, \\nregistration and compliance costs, fees and commissions to be paid to intermediaries, \\nincreased by appropriate Goods and Service Tax (GST) rates and other applicable statutory \\ntaxes charged thereon. Such Set-up Costs can be amortized over the first 36 months, or the \\nentire life of the Category III AIF, commencing from the date of First Closing of the fund. Set-\\nup costs are allocated on a pro-rata basis to all investors, based on their value of total capital \\ncommitments in the fund. \\n \\n• Operating Expenses:  \\n \\nIt includes -  \\no Statutory, legal, tax, accounting, audit, consulting, any other third-party fees \\nand operating expenses related to the Fund and other professional fees; \\no Banking, broken-deal, registration, qualification, finders and similar fees or \\ncommissions; \\no Expenses in connection with meetings of the capital contributors or investors \\n(travel, accommodation and out-of-pocket expenses of contributors will be \\nborne by themselves);  \\no Expense incurred by the Fund for collection of Capital Contributions; \\no Operating, legal and statutory expenses; \\no Interest on borrowings, if any; \\no Costs of financial statements and other reports (including reports to Capital \\nContributors); \\n165 | P a g e  \\n \\no Communications, travel and other expenses; \\no Expenses associated with maintenance of books of accounts and other records \\nof the Fund;  \\no Administration, communication, advertising, promotional, operating, and \\ntransactional expenses (including bank charges) incurred by the Fund; \\no Fees payable to banks, merchant bankers, and any consultants for providing \\nservices to the Fund; \\no Reasonable premiums for insurance for protecting the directors, partners, key \\npersonnel, officers, shareholders, employees and agents of the Trustee and \\nInvestment Manager of the Fund;  \\no Taxes, duties and costs incurred in acquiring, holding and selling the Fund’s \\nassets and other statutory expenses; \\no Proportionate liquidation expenses of the Trust and the Fund; \\n \\n• Transaction Expenses:  \\n \\nCategory III AIF shall bear and pay all transaction expenses in relation to buying, selling or \\ndisposal of Investments. The Transaction Expenses are borne by the Fund and allocated on a \\npro-rata basis, across all classes of units, based on Capital Contributions or NAV: \\n \\no brokerage charges,  \\no depository charges,  \\no custodian transaction charges,  \\no securities transaction taxes,  \\no costs and charges as imposed by stock exchanges. \\n \\n• Trusteeship Fees  \\n \\nTo be in accordance with the terms agreed with the Trustee in the offer letter.   \\n \\nIt is important for investors to identify and note the avoidable expenses being incurred by the \\nFund and negotiate a “Cap” or an upper limit on such expenses with the Investment Manager. \\nSuch expenses are a part of the Operational Expenses and Organization Expenses, such as: \\n• Directors\\' fees and Trusteeship Fees \\n• Professional fees  \\n• Administrative Costs and Office Expenses \\n• Out-of- pocket expenses incurred by the Investment Manager \\n• Fees to third parties such as Merchant Bankers, Custodians, Fund Administrators, \\nDistributors, Legal Advisors, Auditors, Investment Advisors, among others. \\n \\nThe best-case scenario for investors would be to negotiate with the Investment Manager to \\nnet-off such expenses against the Management Fees, already being paid. \\n \\n \\n \\n166 | P a g e  \\n \\n6.1.2 Hurdle Rate \\n \\nThe investors in the Category III AIF have an opportunity cost of investment, when investing \\nin the fund. The opportunity cost is the return foregone on the next best possible investment \\nin the market, in any asset class such as equities, fixed income securities, real estate, \\ncommodities or money market instruments. Therefore, all investors look for securities or \\ninvestment funds that have higher expected returns, compared to the opportunity cost of \\ninvestment. \\n \\nFor this purpose, every Category III AIF Manager sets a “Hurdle Rate” or the minimum rate of \\nreturn to be accrued to fund investors every year, or any shorter reporting period such as \\nquarter or half-year. The return generated using the Hurdle Rate is known as “Preferred \\nReturn”, which is the portion of the total return of the fund that accrues to the investors only. \\nThe Preferred Return will not be taken into account directly, for the purpose of computation \\nof Incentive Fees. Incentives Fees is paid to the Investment Manager on the return generated \\nover and above such Preferred Return. The preferred return is entirely allocated to all the \\ninvestors in the Category III AIF, on a pro-rata basis based on their value of investment in the \\nfund. \\n \\nThe Hurdle Rate is important for the Investment Manager, as it serves as a threshold return \\nover which the Investment Manager will be eligible to earn Incentive Fees. If the Hurdle Rate \\nis high, the Investment Manager will not be able to generate a high incentive fees every year. \\nHence the Investment Manager will prefer to keep the Hurdle Rate low, in order to generate \\na higher incentive fees. Similarly, the Hurdle Rate is important for the Investors too. The \\nInvestors will prefer to keep the Hurdle Rate high, in order to generate higher accrued return \\nfrom the fund. Thus, deciding on the appropriate hurdle rate for a Category III AIF is critical \\nand involves serious negotiations between the Investment Manager and investors in the fund.  \\n \\nFor the purpose of computing the Preferred Return and the Incentive Fees, let us continue \\nour example for Category III AIF – Fund ABC. \\n \\nExample 2: Computation of Hurdle Rate and Incentive Fees: \\n \\nCategory III AIF - Fund ABC is launched on January 01, 2019. Following are the details of the \\nFund: \\n \\nCommitted Capital \\nRs. 50 crore \\nTotal No. of units issued \\n5,00,000 \\nFund Tenure \\n5 years \\nManagement Fees (excl.

Hence, set-up costs \\ncharged in Year 1 will be Rs. 25 lakh. (Rs. 1,25,00,000/5) \\n \\n• Management Fees is computed in the similar manner as computed in Example 1.  \\n \\n• Net Asset Value (Pre-incentives) is calculated by reducing the attributable set-up costs, \\nfund expenses and Management Fees, including GST payable thereon. \\n \\n168 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Reference Hurdle Return is computed using the Called-up Capital at the beginning of \\nthe Year and adding the minimum hurdle rate of return on the capital.  \\n \\n• Amount for calculation of Incentive Fee is the difference between the Net Asset Value \\n(For distribution) and the Reference Hurdle. Such calculation is done as the Incentive \\nFee is to be paid only on the return earned over and above the minimum required \\nreturn i.e. the Reference Hurdle. Hence, Incentive Fees is charged as 15% of this excess \\namount over the Reference Hurdle. \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• There is a sharp increase in the Incentive Fees computed for Year 2. This is due to \\ndouble computation of Incentive Fees, on the Excess Return earned in Year 1. To avoid \\nthis, Investment Managers are paid Incentive Fees only at the end of the fund tenure, \\ninstead of being paid Incentive Fees on a yearly basis. This also ensures that Incentive \\nFees is paid, after providing for future possible losses or decline in the NAV of the fund. \\n \\n• The hurdle rate set by the Investment Manager is low, at 10 percent. This has also \\nresulted in a higher pay-out of Incentive Fees to the Investment Manager. \\no If the Hurdle Rate is increased to 12 percent, the Incentive Fees drops \\nsignificantly as follows:  \\n▪ Year 1 – Rs. 6,35,100 \\n▪ Year 2 – Rs. 8,69,250 \\n \\n6.1.3 High-Water Mark  \\n \\nAs discussed above, Incentive Fees are payable to the Investment Manager as an incentive to \\ngenerate profits or ‘Alpha’ for the Category III AIF. However, due to inherent market risks, it \\nis possible that the investment strategy adopted may generate a loss in any year of the fund \\nlife-cycle. For instance, a Category III AIF may generate a 20 percent return in its first year, -5 \\npercent returns in the second year and 11 percent return in the third year. \\n \\nIn order to ensure alignment of interest of the Investment Manager with the Category III AIF, \\nand to safeguard the interest of investors in the Category III AIF, no incentive fees should be \\npaid on losses made in any year, through-out the life cycle of the Fund. The concept of High-\\nWater Mark is introduced for this purpose. \\nHigh-Water Mark is the highest Net Asset Value, net of operating expenses, transaction \\nexpenses and management fees, achieved by the Category III AIF at the end of the year. If the \\nNet Asset Value has only decreased since inception of the fund, High-Water Mark is taken as \\nthe initial subscription price of units issued by such fund. \\n \\nThe High-Water Mark is an important input used in addition to the Hurdle Rate, to compute \\nthe Incentive Fees payable to the Investment Manager. \\n \\n169 | P a g e  \\n \\nIf the High-Water Mark of the Category III AIF is consistently rising above the previous High-\\nWater Mark, it denotes superior past and present performance of the fund and is a good \\nindicator for the future estimated returns of the Fund. This is important for the Investment \\nManager to showcase superior fund performance to investors and prospective clients, while \\nearning higher Incentive Fees. However, if the High-Water Mark remains unchanged in \\nprevious years, it is an indicator of poor performance. \\n \\nLet us understand the importance of High-Water Mark and calculation of Incentive Fees, by \\ncontinuing our example for Category III AIF – Fund ABC. \\n \\nExample 3: High-Water Mark and Computation of Incentive Fees: \\n \\nLet us take two different scenarios for the computation of Incentive Fees, with High-Water \\nMark: \\n• Best-case Scenario – Above-average Net Returns for the Fund, above 12 percent p.a. \\n• Worst-case Scenario– Average Net Returns for the Fund, less than 12 percent p.a. \\n \\nCategory III AIF - Fund ABC is launched on January 01, 2019. Following are the details of the \\nFund: \\n \\nCommitted Capital \\nRs. 50 crore \\nTotal No. of units issued \\n5,00,000 \\nFund Tenure \\n5 years \\nManagement Fees (excl.

For the second \\nyear, High-Water Mark denotes the highest Net Asset Value (Pre-incentives) achieved \\nby the Fund at the beginning of Year 2, which is Rs. 56,42,34,000. \\n \\n• For the purpose of computing Incentive Fees, it is important to ascertain the minimum \\nNAV eligible for an Incentive Fee, which is higher of Reference Hurdle and the High-\\nWater Mark. If the difference between the NAV (Pre-incentives) and such minimum \\nNAV is positive, then the Investment Manager is eligible for an Incentive Fees at the \\ngiven rate of 15 percent. Incentive Fees are computed on the difference between the \\nNAV (Pre-incentives) and such minimum NAV. If the difference between the NAV (Pre-\\nincentives) and such minimum NAV is negative, then the Investment Manager shall \\nnot be eligible for any Incentive Fees. \\n \\n• High-Water Mark adds another threshold to be met by the Investment Manager. By \\ntaking the higher of both the amounts, viz. High-Water Mark and Reference Hurdle, it \\ncan be verified if the Investment Manager has achieved the Reference Hurdle for \\ninvestors as well as added value for them, by increasing Net Asset Value of the Fund. \\n171 | P a g e  \\n \\nWorst Case Scenario: Calculation of High-Water Mark and Incentive Fees \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nRs.

For the \\nsecond year, High-Water Mark denotes the highest Net Asset Value (Pre-incentives) \\nachieved by the Fund at the beginning of Year 2, which is Rs. 53,47,65,000. \\n \\n• It is observed that the NAV (Pre-incentives) is higher than the High-Water Mark, but \\nlower than the Reference Hurdle. Since the NAV has not crossed the Reference Hurdle, \\nthe Investment Manager is NOT eligible for any Incentive Fees. \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• In Year 2 of the Worst-case Scenario, the Net Asset Value of the Fund was below the \\nHigh-Water Mark, due to which the Investment Manager was ineligible for Incentive \\nFees. In such cases, if investors have not negotiated a Hurdle Rate at the time of \\n172 | P a g e  \\n \\nsubscription, the High-Water Mark prevents undue Incentives Fees being payable to \\nInvestment Manager and serves as an additional threshold. \\n \\n• There is a sharp decrease in the Incentive Fees payable to the Investment Manager, \\nwhen comparing the fund performance in the Best-case Scenario and the Worst-case \\nScenario. Total Incentive Fees payable in 2 years was Rs.63,34,350 in the best-case \\nscenario, as compared to Zero Incentive Fees in the worst-case scenario. This \\nhighlights the importance of High-Water Marks and Hurdle Rates as key thresholds. \\n \\n6.1.4 Comparative Analysis: Fee Structure  \\n \\nFee Structure of Mutual Funds v/s Category III AIFs \\n \\nAs discussed above, the primary components of the Fees charged by a Category III AIF are: \\n \\n1. Management Fees \\n2. Incentive Fees \\n \\nA Mutual Fund is also a pooled investment vehicle which collects capital contributions, from \\nretail investors and institutional investors, to invest the pooled capital in equity or debt \\nsecurities for the time horizon mentioned in the offer document of the Fund. The Mutual \\nFund also appoints an Investment Manager, who provides fund management services to the \\nFund using their investment knowledge, market experience and industry exposure. \\n \\nThe Fee Structure for Mutual Funds is calculated using the Total Expense Ratio (TER), as per \\nSEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulation, 1996. The fees charged by Mutual Fund include many \\ncomponents, such as: \\n• Investment Management Fees \\n• Advisory Fees \\n• Registrar and Transfer Agent Fees \\n• Legal and Audit fees \\n• Distributor Commissions and Marketing Expenses \\n• Transaction costs \\n• Custodian Fees \\n• Operational costs \\n• Insurance costs \\n• On-going service charges and other costs \\n \\nAll such expenses involved in the management of mutual funds are together known as the \\nTotal Expense Ratio (TER), which denotes the fee charged by the mutual fund scheme to \\nmanage the investments on behalf of the investors. The TER is expressed as a percentage of \\nthe assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund.123 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the \\n                                                          \\n \\n123 Asset under management (AUM) of the mutual fund scheme is calculated by taking the average of its daily \\nnet assets, in the reporting period. TER Limit is computed based on the AUM calculated. \\n173 | P a g e  \\n \\nFund is reported after deduction of the TER from the Gross Assets of the Fund, as on a \\nparticular date. \\n \\nSEBI, vide its various circulars, has fixed the upper cap of the TER chargeable by the mutual \\nfunds to protect the interests of the investors. TER Limit includes all expenses of the Fund, \\nincluding Advisory Fees and Investment Management Fees. The Investment Manager is not \\npermitted to charge any additional fee above the prescribed TER Limits. Permissible expenses \\nbeyond the TER Limit of the mutual fund scheme are mentioned in the SEBI (Mutual Funds) \\nRegulations, 1996. \\n \\nSEBI has put the specified limits on all the expenses and fees charged by the mutual fund, \\nincluding advisory fees and investment management fees. TER limits serve as a cap on the \\nfees charged by the mutual fund scheme, in order to align the interest of the Investment \\nManager with the investors in the mutual fund scheme. However, such restrictions result in \\nlimits on the advisory fee or management fee income for the Investment Manager of the \\nMutual Fund, which practically comes to less than 1.5 percent of the Assets under \\nManagement (AUM) of the Fund. In comparison to this, a Category III AIF can charge a \\nManagement Fee of up to 2.5 percent of the Total Asset Value of the Fund.  \\n \\nIn addition to the cap on the investment management fees and advisory fees, the Investment \\nManager is prohibited from charging Incentive Fees, which is a share in the profit generated \\nby the mutual fund scheme. Such restrictions are placed in order to limit the risk and leverage \\ntaken by the Investment Manager of the mutual fund, as well as safeguard the interests of \\nretail investors with a limited risk appetite. However, institutional investors and High Net-\\nworth Individual (HNI) investors in a Category III AIF have adequate risk appetite to invest in \\nrisky securities and take leverage. Hence, a Category III AIF Investment Manager is permitted \\nto invest in risky securities and take leverage. \\n \\nOther operating expenses, third party fees, marketing expenses, custodian fees, registrar fees \\nand transaction costs are covered in the TER limit for a mutual fund scheme, unless otherwise \\nspecified by the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. This further limits the amount that \\ncan be charged as advisory fees or investment management fees, by the Investment Manager \\nof a mutual fund. In comparison to this, Investment Manager of a Category III AIF can charge \\nManagement Fees, in addition to operating expenses, transaction costs, distribution costs, \\ncustodian fees, trusteeship fees and administration costs incurred by the fund. Table 6.1 \\nsummarizes the differences in Fees Structure of Category III AIF and Mutual Funds: \\n \\nTable 6.1: Fees Structure – Mutual Funds v/s Category III AIFs \\nFee Component \\nMutual Fund \\nCategory III AIF \\nManagement Fees \\nTER limits for a mutual fund \\nscheme place restrictions on the \\ninvestment management fees \\ncharged by the Investment \\nManager of a mutual fund. \\n \\n \\nManagement Fees can be charged \\nat the discretion of the Investment \\nManager, usually up to 2.5% of the \\nTotal Assets of the Fund as per \\nindustry \\npractice, \\nwithout \\nrestrictions \\nfrom \\nSEBI. \\n \\n174 | P a g e  \\n \\nTER for a mutual fund is taken as \\na percentage of “Assets under \\nManagement” of the mutual \\nfund scheme.  \\nManagement Fees is computed as \\na percentage of “Total Assets” of \\nthe Category III AIF, which is \\nbefore the deduction of all fund \\nliabilities \\nand \\nexpenses. \\n \\nIncentive Fees \\nInvestment Managers are not \\npermitted to charge Incentive \\nFees. \\nInvestment \\nManagers \\nare \\npermitted to charge Incentive \\nFees, usually up to 20% of \\nIncremental Returns of the Fund \\nas per industry practice, without \\nrestrictions \\nfrom \\nSEBI. \\n \\nOther Operating \\nExpenses \\nAll operating expenses and \\ntransaction costs are covered in \\nthe TER limit, unless otherwise \\nspecified by SEBI. \\nManagement Fees is charged in \\naddition to all operating expenses \\nand transaction costs incurred by \\nthe fund.  \\n \\nThe \\noperating \\nexpenses \\nare \\nusually capped by the Category III \\nAIF, up to 0.5% of AUM. Operating \\nExpenses are charged based on \\nactuals, up to the capped limit. \\n \\n \\nIn 2019, SEBI had amended the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations to reduce the TER Limits on \\nall mutual fund schemes. This has indirectly reduced the limit on the investment management \\nfees and advisory fees to be charged by Investment Managers of mutual funds.  \\n \\nAs a result of the reduction in the TER limit for mutual fund schemes, many mutual fund \\nmanagers have now launched their own Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), based on their \\nindustry experience and industry network. \\n \\nFee Structure of PMS v/s Category III AIFs \\n \\nPortfolio Management Services (PMS) is not a pooled investment vehicle like AIFs. It is a \\ncustomized service offered to high net-worth investors and institutional investors. In order to \\nbe eligible to provide services under PMS, the Portfolio Manager must have a minimum Net \\nworth of Rs. 5 crore and collect a minimum investment of Rs. 50 lakh from a single investor. \\nThe Portfolio Manager invests capital on behalf of their investors, or provides investment \\nadvice to the investors depending upon the type of the portfolio management services opted \\nby the investor, as per the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 2020. \\n \\nPortfolio Managers of PMS also charge Management Fees and Performance Fees to their \\ninvestors. There is, however, no limit on fees or benchmark rates set by the regulator on this \\nbehalf, as in the case of the mutual funds. The fee charged by the Portfolio Manager is as per \\n175 | P a g e  \\n \\nthe agreement with the investors for rendering portfolio management services. The Portfolio \\nManager can charge customized fees to the investors, based on the investor profile, targeted \\nmarket segment, tenure of the fund and other macro-economic factors or risks.  \\n \\nAll investors are provided the flexibility to choose the fee structure of their PMS account, \\nunlike investors in a Category III AIF, wherein one class of investors are charged the same fee \\nstructure as determined by the Investment Manager. For example, a Portfolio Manager can \\ncharge 2.5 percent Management Fees to one class of investors and charge 1 percent \\nManagement Fees plus 15 percent Incentive Fees to a second class of investors. In this case, \\nthe Portfolio Manager can give an option to the prospective investors to choose between a \\n“fixed fee” and “fixed plus variable fee”.  \\n \\nFee Structures of a Category III AIF and PMS are almost similar, with a few notable differences, \\nas follows: \\n \\n• Category III AIF managers do not provide an option to the prospective investors, to \\nchoose between two different fee structures. Every class of units issued by a Category \\nIII AIF has a pre-determined fee structure. \\n \\n• Category III AIF managers typically do not charge a higher Management Fees and \\nIncentive Fees, as compared to portfolio managers. Portfolio Managers may charge \\nManagement Fees ranging from 2 percent to 3 percent of total assets and Incentive \\nFees up to 40 percent of the profits earned in the client account. This fee structure \\nmainly depends on the terms of subscription agreement signed with the investors. \\n \\nApart from Management Fees and Incentives Fees, both AIF and PMS charge other operating \\nexpenses and costs to the investors. However, in the case of the PMS, SEBI has provided more \\nrestrictions as compared to Category III AIFs, in the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, \\n2020 on such additional fees charged by the PMS, such as Distribution Fees, Expenses, Exit \\nLoads and Upfront Fees:  \\n \\n• A Portfolio Manager is banned from charging upfront fees, such as Registration Fees \\nor Subscription Fees, to the investors directly or indirectly. This enhances transparency \\nand accountability of the Portfolio Manager and Distributors. \\n \\n• Operating Expenses, other than brokerage, charged by the PMS shall not exceed 0.5 \\npercent every year, on the investor’s average daily AUM. Brokerage fees should be \\ncharged at actuals and disclosed periodically to the investors. \\n \\n• Exit Load can be charged to investors on the amount redeemed at maximum 3 percent \\nif investments are redeemed in the first year, maximum 2 percent if investments are \\nredeemed in the second year and maximum 1 percent if investments are redeemed in \\nthe third year of the PMS. No Exit Load can be charged subsequently to investors, after \\nthe end of third year of the PMS. \\n \\n176 | P a g e  \\n \\n• The PMS should adopt a full-trail commission method for paying distribution fees to \\nPMS distributors, similar to the method adopted for the mutual fund industry. This \\nmeans that distributors’ commission shall not be paid at the time of investor’s \\ninvestment (akin to mutual fund subscription to units), but paid subsequently every \\nQuarter or other periodic time frame till the investor exits the PMS. Full-trail \\ncommission ensures that the Portfolio Manager, Distributors as well as Investors stay \\ninvested with the PMS for a long-term and the interests are aligned. \\n \\n6.1.5 Gross (Pre-fees) and Net (Post-fees) Returns of a Category III AIF \\n \\nA high pay-out of the Incentive Fees can substantially impact the Net Return earned by the \\ninvestors. A Category III AIF, making a high pay-out of Incentive Fees, will deliver decreasing \\nNet Return on Investment, to the investors. Hence, investors should check the quantum of \\nincentive fee being charged by the Investment Manager, for every class of units being issued \\nby the Category III AIF. \\n \\nIt is important to note that: \\n• Pre-fees return, or the gross return on investment, is calculated using the Gross Asset \\nValue of the Category III AIF. Such return is the gross return earned on investments, \\nbefore deducting the fund expenses, costs, management fees and incentive fees. \\n \\n• Post-fees return will be calculated on the following two parameters: \\no Net Return (Pre-Incentives): This return is calculated using the Net Asset Value \\nof the Category III AIF, after deducting the fund expenses, costs and \\nmanagement fees, but before deducting the incentive fees. \\no Net Return (Post-Incentives): This return is calculated using the Net Asset \\nValue of the Category III AIF, after deducting the fund expenses, costs, \\nmanagement fees as well as the incentive fees. \\n \\nThe other common issue when computing Gross return and Net return is the impact of taxes \\npaid by the Category III AIF, if any. The taxation of pre-fees return and post-fees return is \\ndiscussed in detail in Unit 9. \\n \\nLet us understand the importance of Incentive Fees and calculate Pre-fees Return and Post-\\nfees Return for investors, by continuing our example for Category III AIF – Fund ABC. \\n \\nExample 5: Pre-Fees and Post-Fees Return: \\n \\nSame scenarios are taken for computation of Pre-fees Return and Post-fees Return: \\n \\n• Best-case Scenario – Above-average Net Returns for the Fund, above 12 percent p.a. \\n• Worst-case Scenario– Average Net Returns for the Fund, less than 12 percent p.a. \\n \\n \\n \\n177 | P a g e  \\n \\nYear 1: Data from the previous Examples \\n \\nParticulars \\nBest-case Scenario \\nWorst-case Scenario \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nNAV  \\nper unit \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nNAV  \\nper unit \\nGross Asset Value \\nRs. 58,00,00,000 1160.000 \\nRs. 55,00,00,000 1100.000 \\nNAV: Pre-incentives \\nRs. 56,42,34,000 1128.468 \\nRs. 53,47,65,000 1069.530 \\nNAV: Post-incentives \\nRs. 56,20,98,900 1124.198 \\nRs. 53,47,65,000 1069.530 \\n \\nYear 2: Data from the previous Examples \\n \\nParticulars \\nBest-case Scenario \\nWorst-case Scenario \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nNAV  \\nper unit \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nNAV  \\nper unit \\nGross Asset Value \\nRs. 65,00,00,000 1300.000 \\nRs. 54,00,00,000 1080.000 \\nNAV: Pre-Incentives \\nRs. 63,29,95,000 1265.990 \\nRs. 52,49,42,000 1049.884 \\nNAV: Post-Incentives \\nRs. 62,87,95,750 1257.592 \\nRs. 52,49,42,000 1049.884 \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nReturns are calculated, based on per unit values in the table. \\n \\nYear 1: Comparison of Pre-fees and Post-fees Return \\n \\nParticulars \\nBest-case Scenario \\nWorst-case Scenario \\nNAV per unit \\n(Rs.) \\nReturn (%) \\nNAV per unit \\n(Rs.) \\nReturn (%) \\nInitial Investment \\n1000.000 \\n \\n1000.000 \\n \\nGross Asset Value \\n1160.000 \\n16.00% \\n1100.000 \\n10.00% \\nNAV - Pre-Incentives \\n1128.468 \\n12.85% \\n1069.530 \\n6.95% \\nNAV - Post-Incentives \\n1124.198 \\n12.42% \\n1069.530 \\n6.95% \\n \\nYear 2: Comparison of Pre-fees and Post-fees Return \\n \\nParticulars \\nBest-case Scenario \\nWorst-case Scenario \\nNAV per unit \\n(Rs.) \\nCAGR  \\nReturn (%)* \\nNAV per unit \\n(Rs.) \\nCAGR \\nReturn (%) \\nGross Asset Value \\n1300.000 \\n14.02% \\n1080.000 \\n3.92% \\nNAV - Pre-Incentives \\n1265.990 \\n12.52% \\n1049.884 \\n2.46% \\nNAV - Post-Incentives \\n1257.592 \\n12.14% \\n1049.884 \\n2.46% \\n*Box 6.1 provides the formula for computing CAGR. \\n \\n \\n \\n178 | P a g e  \\n \\nBox 6.1: CAGR Computation \\n \\nCompounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is the measure of the annual growth rate of the \\nfund, after accounting for the effect of compounding. The CAGR for the fund is computed \\nusing the following formula: \\n \\n𝐶𝐴𝐺𝑅= [ 𝐸𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒\\n𝐵𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒]\\n1\\n𝑛\\n−1 \\n \\nwhere: \\nEnding Value - NAV of Fund ABC after Year 2 \\nBeginning Value - Initial NAV of Fund ABC, at the beginning of Year 1, i.e. Rs. 1000 \\nn - Total number of years for which the investment was made, i.e. 2 years \\n \\nFrom the tables above: \\n• Initial Investment in Year 1 is the initial corpus of Rs. 50 crore, which is subscribed \\nthrough 5 lakh units at an NAV of Rs. 1,000. \\n \\n• NAV – Pre-Incentives is computed after reducing the Fund Expenses such as Initial Set-\\nup Cost, Yearly Expenses and Management Fees. All the above mentioned expenses \\nare fixed expenses and to be borne by all the investors, on a proportionate basis. \\n \\n• NAV – Post-Incentives is computed after reducing the Incentive Fees computed for \\nthat year.  \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• On comparison of Pre-fees and Post-fees returns in the Best-case scenario: \\n \\no In Year 1, it is observed that the fund generated a return of 16.00% on a gross-\\nbasis, which is exceptional. However, due to high fixed costs, fees and \\nexpenses incurred in Year 1, the Net Return (Pre-Incentives) was dropped to \\n12.85%. The Incentive Fees will be computed for Year 1, on account of the \\nIncremental Return earned by the Investment Manager in that year, which \\nresulted in further drop of the Net Return (Post-Incentives) to 12.42%.  \\n \\no In Year 2, the investment manager had not performed well compared to \\nperformance in Year 1. This can be observed from the changes in Gross Asset \\nValue of the fund itself. Gross Asset Value at the end of Year 1 was Rs. 58 crore, \\nwhile the Gross Asset Value at the end of Year 2 was Rs. 65 crore. The \\ninvestment manager generated a marginally lower return in Year 2, and the \\nCompounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) return of the fund over two years \\ndropped to 14.02% on a gross-basis. Similarly, the Net Return (Pre-Incentive) \\ndropped to 12.52% and the Net Return (Post-Incentive) dropped to 12.14%, \\nwhen computed on a CAGR basis. \\n179 | P a g e  \\n \\no It may be noted that the Incentive Fees is not be payable to the Investment \\nManager, before end of the fund tenure. \\n \\n• On comparison of Pre-fees and Post-fees returns in the Worst-case scenario: \\n \\no In Year 1, it is observed that the fund generated a muted return of 10.00% on \\na gross-basis. On account of the high fixed expenses of the fund, the Net Return \\n(Pre-Incentive) was only 6.95%. Since the Net Return (Pre-Incentive) was less \\nthan the Reference Hurdle, the investment manager is not eligible for any \\nIncentives Fees and hence, the Net Return (Post-Incentive) was also 6.95% \\nonly. \\n \\no In Year 2, the performance of the investment manager had worsened, as \\nobserved from the changes in Gross Asset Value of the fund. Gross Asset Value \\nat the end of Year 1 was Rs. 55 crore, while the Gross Asset Value at the end \\nof Year 2 was Rs. 54 crore. The investment manager generated a negative \\nreturn in Year 2, and the CAGR return of the fund over two years dropped to \\n3.92% on a gross-basis. In this case, the Investment Manager is not eligible for \\nan Incentive Fees, as the NAV is below the Reference Hurdle as well as the \\nHigh-Water Mark. Hence, the Net Return (Pre-Incentive) is equal to the Net \\nReturn (Post-Incentive), which has significantly dropped to a mere 2.46%, \\nwhen computed on a CAGR basis.  \\n \\n• The comparison of Best-case Scenario Returns and Worst-case Scenario Returns \\nhighlight the importance of every constituent in the Fee Structure of a Category III AIF, \\nbeing Management Fees, Incentive Fees and the additional Fixed Costs incurred by the \\nFund. \\n \\nThe above return calculations are made before taking into account the treatment of Direct \\nTaxes, on the business income and capital gains generated by the Fund. The Net Return to the \\nInvestors is calculated based on the Post-Tax NAV, which is distributed to the investors. \\n \\n6.2 Fund Performance Measurement Tools \\n \\nFund performance is most actively monitored by all the stakeholders of a Category III AIF, \\nbeing the investment manager, investors, sponsor, custodian, trustees, financial institutions \\nas well as the market regulator. Return attribution plays a crucial role for the Investment \\nManager to get future capital contributions from new and existing investors. Historical \\nperformance and risk-return measures are used for comparison of various Category III AIFs in \\nthe market and fund allocation. The Category III AIF with the highest return and which \\noutperforms the market will become the most preferred fund for future allocations. However, \\ninvestors need to be cautious that historical performance does not guarantee the same return \\nin future, as Category III AIF investments are subject to market risks. Box 6.2 provides a brief \\noverview on the Global Investment Performance Standards followed by AIFs worldwide. \\n \\n180 | P a g e  \\n \\nBox 6.2: Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) \\n \\nAlternative Investment Funds are recommended to comply with the Global Investment \\nPerformance Standards (GIPS®), to ensure full disclosures and fair performance \\npresentation which helps to advance fair competitive practices within the industry and \\nmeet the demands of prospective clients and investors. The GIPS are recognized as a global \\nstandard for calculating and presenting investment performance around the world. \\n \\nThe mission of the GIPS is to promote ethics and integrity in the investment management \\nindustry and to build trust within the investors, by achieving standardized performance \\nreporting and compliance by asset owners and asset managers. \\n \\nInvestment Management Firms, like AIFs, should adhere to the best practices in calculation \\nand presentation of performance, recommended by GIPS. A Category III AIF being a pooled \\ninvestment vehicle must report the consolidated performance of all its schemes in different \\ncomposites. A Composite can be defined based on investment strategy or investment \\nobjective to be followed by the schemes within the composite. \\n \\nIn addition to this, the GIPS require firms to adhere to certain calculation methodologies \\nwhich ensure integrity of the input data used in performance presentations, such as \\nvaluation of underlying portfolio holdings of the fund. Such calculation methodologies \\nenhance the comparability of investment performance across different investment firms. \\n \\nAn AIF should present annual investment performance, compliant with the GIPS, for a \\nminimum period of five years, or since the inception of the fund. Prospectively, the AIF \\nmust present an additional year of performance each year, building up to a minimum of 10 \\nyears of GIPS-compliant performance. \\n \\n6.2.1 Return Metrics \\n6.2.1.1 Internal Rate of Return  \\n \\nInternal Rate of Rate (IRR) is the return based on timing of the cash flows generated by the \\nCategory III AIF. IRR represents the rate of return at which the present value of the cash \\noutflows for the investors is equal to the present value of inflows. The timing of the cash flow \\nis important in IRR. IRR computes the time period for every investment in the fund and \\naccordingly calculates the time-weighted return generated by such investment.   \\n \\nFor example, a return of 15 percent generated by one investment may be over a time period \\nof one year or three years. Certainly, investors will prefer the investment return to be \\ngenerated in a shorter period of time, i.e. one year in the example. IRR is important for \\ncomputing fund performance, as most Category III AIFs are illiquid in nature and hence, return \\ngenerated by the Category III AIF should be computed on a yearly basis, based on the time \\nperiods for which capital was invested in the Fund. \\n \\n181 | P a g e  \\n \\nIRR is computed in multiple ways, such as: \\n \\nSince-inception IRR: Since-inception IRR is calculated using the cash inflows and cash \\noutflows, generated since the launch date of the fund, till the date of calculating and reporting \\nthe IRR to the investors. If the IRR is being computed for a previous fund which was liquidated, \\nit is also known as Life-time IRR. \\nGross IRR: Gross IRR is calculated with the cash inflows and cash outflows at the fund level, \\nbefore deducting management fees, incentive fees, fund expenses and taxes paid. Cash \\noutflows for investors will be total capital calls made by the fund and cash inflows will be the \\nnet distribution received from the fund, for the purpose of calculating the Gross IRR. Gross \\nIRR calculates the Gross Return generated by the Fund, without taking into account the \\nexpenses borne by the Fund, which is indirectly allocated to the investors on a pro-rata basis. \\n \\nNet IRR: Net IRR is calculated with the cash inflows and cash outflows at the investor level. \\nInvestors will calculate cash outflows such as capital commitments made for investments, \\nmanagement fees, incentive fees and fund expenses. Cash inflows will be calculated using the \\ndistributions made by the fund, after deducting taxes paid. Net IRR treats all fund-level \\nexpenses as the expenses borne by the investors, indirectly. Hence, Net IRR will be lower than \\nthe Gross IRR of the fund. \\n \\nFor understanding Gross IRR and Net IRR concepts, let us continue with the example of \\nCategory III AIF – Fund ABC: \\n \\nExample 6: Gross IRR and Net IRR: \\n \\nCategory III AIF - Fund ABC is launched on January 01, 2019. Following are the details: \\n \\nCommitted Capital \\nRs. 50 crore \\nTotal No. of units issued \\n5,00,000 \\nFund-life \\n5 years \\nManagement Fees (excl.

It can be observed that the Incentive Fees pay-out is \\nmade only in the last year of the Fund, after taking into account the Reference Hurdle and \\nHigh-Water Mark for last year. In this case, most Category III AIF Managers consider paying \\nIncentive Fees on the difference between the NAV (Pre-incentives) and the Hurdle Rate, \\nwithout considering the High-Water Mark. However, for the interest of investors, the \\nIncentive Fees must be paid after taking into account the Reference Hurdle as well as the \\nHigh-Water Mark for last year of the fund scheme.  \\n \\nNAV (Pre-tax) is computed after deducting the Incentive Fees pay-out in Year 5. Also note that \\nNet Distribution is made in the last year, as per the buy-and-hold strategy of the fund. Hence, \\nlong-term capital gain tax is paid at time of distribution @ 10%, with an additional 15% \\nsurcharge and 4% education cess. Net NAV (Post-tax) is equal to the amount of total \\ndistributions made, at the end of Year 5 of the fund. \\n \\nIn order to compute the Gross IRR, all cash inflows and outflows are identified. Cash outflows \\nfor the investors are the capital commitments and the only cash inflow is the Net Distribution. \\nAll other expenses will be ignored for the computation of Gross IRR. The date and amount of \\nall cash inflows and cash outflows are mentioned in the following table: \\n \\nCash Inflows and Cash Outflows: Gross IRR for Best-case Scenario \\n \\nDate \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nOutflows: \\n \\n01-01-2019 \\n    (50,00,00,000) \\nInflows: \\n \\n31-12-2023 \\n101,70,66,623 \\n \\nIt is important to note that the cash outflow for January 01, 2019 is Rs. 50 crore, as we are \\ncomputing cash outflows and not total assets.

Similarly, tax expenses are paid \\nby the Category III AIF, at the end of 2023.  \\n \\n• Incentive Fees will not be paid to the Investment Manager in the last year of the fund \\nlife, on account of low Net Asset Value of the fund.  \\n \\nUsing the XIRR function on Excel and solving for IRR, we get Net IRR = 3.38% \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\nFrom the IRRs calculated, we observe that: \\n \\n• Net IRR can substantially be below the Gross IRR, if the Category III AIF has high fixed \\ncosts in terms of set-up costs, operating expenses, management fees and incentive \\nfees. \\n \\n• The decrease in Net IRR can be more in a Worst-case scenario, when the Investment \\nManager is generating average or below average returns.

Apart from the return generated by a Category III AIF, \\ninvestors are more concerned with the amount of actual investment return “distributed” by \\nthe fund. If a Category III AIF is generating superior returns, only to reinvest back in the Fund, \\ninvestors will need to repeatedly bear all the market risks on such return earned for the \\nsubsequent years. In case of open-ended Category III AIFs, Distribution of capital by the Fund \\nis the most important parameter for judging the performance of the fund. The Investment \\nManager of a Category III AIF, investing in illiquid securities through a recognized stock \\nexchange platform or otherwise, should be able to distribute realized profits to the investors, \\nthereby controlling the inherent illiquidity risk within the fund. Investors shall not treat “Fund \\nReturn” as “Investor Return”, until the return earned has been distributed in the form of \\ndividends, interest, and distribution or in any other manner. \\n \\nIn order to compare the distributions made by a Category III AIF, across multiple funds with \\ncomparable fund-term, the following concepts are taken into consideration: \\n \\n• Distributions to Paid-in Capital (DPI): \\n \\nDPI is the ratio between the total distributions made by the fund and the total capital \\ncontributions made by the investors. DPI measures the total amount distributed by the fund, \\nper rupee of investment.  \\n \\nDPI    =    Total Distributions \\n                Total Capital Contributions \\n \\nInvestors may prefer the Distributions from the fund to be made early, if the fund is \\ngenerating average returns. Hence, in such circumstances, a high value of DPI is preferred by \\nthe investors in the early years of the fund. However, if the fund is generating above-average \\nreturns, the investors may prefer the Distributions to be deferred, to stay invested in the fund. \\n \\n• Residual Value to Paid-in Capital (RVPI): \\n \\nRVPI is the ratio between the unrealized value of investments made by the fund and the total \\ncapital contributions made by the investors. The unrealized value of investments shall be \\ndistributed to the investors in the coming years. However, such investments still bear the \\nmarket risks relating to the investments and do not guarantee a return similar to the past \\n189 | P a g e  \\n \\nreturns of the funds. The unrealized investments represent the residual value of the fund after \\ndistribution, in other words, the Assets under Management of the Fund. \\n \\nRVPI  =    Assets under Management   \\n   Total Capital Contributions \\n \\nInvestors always prefer the AUM of the fund to be increasing. If the returns generated by the \\nfund are above-average, the AUM increases at a faster rate and the investors would prefer a \\nhigh RVPI, in such circumstances. However, if the fund generates average or below-average \\nreturns, the investors would not prefer a high RVPI and ask for distributions or redemptions. \\n \\n• Total Value to Paid-in Capital (TVPI): \\n \\nTVPI measures the Total Value generated by the fund, till the reporting date. Total Value \\nrepresents the total of distributions plus the unrealized value of investments in the fund. TVPI \\nis the ratio between the Total Value generated by the fund and the total capital contributions \\nmade by the investors.  \\n \\nTVPI  =     Distributions   +  Assets under Management   \\n \\n \\nTotal Capital Contributions \\n \\nAlternatively, TVPI can be represented as summation of RVPI and DPI, i.e., \\n \\nTVPI = RVPI + DPI \\n \\nInvestors will always prefer a high TVPI, as it measures the Total Value generated, whether by \\ndistributions made or the value of unrealized assets in the fund. \\n \\nFor understanding TVPI, DPI and RVPI, let us continue with the example of Category III AIF – \\nFund ABC: \\n \\nExample 7: DPI, RVPI and TVPI: \\n \\nCategory III AIF - Fund ABC is launched on January 01, 2019. Following are the details: \\n \\nThe Fund follows a Buy-and-Hold strategy. As per this strategy, all the assets of the fund are \\nreinvested in the next year and net assets of the fund are distributed, at liquidation. \\n \\nSame scenarios are taken for computation of Gross IRR and Net IRR: \\n• Best-case Scenario – Above-average Net Returns for the Fund, above 12 percent p.a. \\n• Worst-case Scenario– Average Net Returns for the Fund, less than 12 percent p.a. \\n \\n \\n \\n190 | P a g e  \\n \\nCommitted Capital \\nRs. 50 crore \\nTotal No. of units issued \\n5,00,000 \\nFund-life \\n5 years \\n \\nThe below table summarizes the value of Net Assets of the fund in both scenarios, at the end \\nof each year, as per the calculations made in all the previous examples: \\n \\nParticulars \\nBest-case \\nScenario (Rs.) \\nWorst-case \\nScenario (Rs.) \\nUnrealized AUM: \\n \\n \\nNet AUM (as on December 31 2019) \\n56,42,34,000.00 \\n53,47,65,000.00 \\nNet AUM (as on December 31 2020) \\n63,29,95,000.00 \\n52,49,42,000.00 \\nNet AUM (as on December 31 2021) \\n75,08,71,000.00 \\n57,40,57,000.00 \\nNet AUM (as on December 31 2022) \\n87,85,70,000.00 \\n63,29,95,000.00 \\nDistributions: \\n \\n \\nDistribution made on December 31, 2023 \\n101,70,66,623.00 \\n66,03,29,644.00 \\n \\nCalculate and analyse TVPI, DPI and RVPI for all five years. \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nFor the purpose of calculating the TVPI, DPI and RVPI, we summarize the data for all five years \\nas under: \\n \\nBest-case Scenario: \\n \\nParticulars \\n2019 (Rs.) \\n2020 (Rs.) \\n2021 (Rs.) \\n2022 (Rs.) \\n2023 (Rs.) \\nTotal Capital \\nContribution \\n(A) \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,000 \\nTotal \\nDistributions \\n(B) \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- 1,01,70,66,623 \\nAssets Under \\nManagement \\n(Unrealized) \\n(C) \\n56,42,34,00\\n0  \\n63,29,95,00\\n0  \\n75,08,71,00\\n0  \\n87,85,70,00\\n0  \\n \\nDPI  \\n[D = B/A] \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n2.03 \\nRVPI  \\n[E = C/A] \\n1.13 \\n1.27 \\n1.50 \\n1.76 \\n- \\n191 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars \\n2019 (Rs.) \\n2020 (Rs.) \\n2021 (Rs.) \\n2022 (Rs.) \\n2023 (Rs.) \\nTVPI  \\n[F = D+E] \\n1.13 \\n1.27 \\n1.50 \\n1.76 \\n2.03 \\n \\nIn 2023, since total net assets under management were distributed, value of unrealized assets \\nis NIL. \\n \\nWorst-case Scenario: \\n \\nParticulars \\n2019 (Rs.) \\n2020 (Rs.) \\n2021 (Rs.) \\n2022 (Rs.) \\n2023 (Rs.) \\nTotal Capital \\nContribution \\n(A) \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,00\\n0 \\n50,00,00,000 \\nTotal \\nDistributions \\n(B) \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n66,03,29,644 \\nAssets Under \\nManagement \\n(Unrealized) \\n(C) \\n53,47,65,00\\n0 \\n52,49,42,00\\n0  \\n57,40,57,00\\n0  \\n63,29,95,00\\n0  \\n \\nDPI  \\n[D = B/A] \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n1.32 \\nRVPI  \\n[E = C/A] \\n1.07 \\n1.05 \\n1.15 \\n1.27 \\n- \\nTVPI  \\n[F = D+E] \\n1.07 \\n1.05 \\n1.15 \\n1.27 \\n1.32 \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• In the best-case scenario: \\no TVPI is constantly increasing every year, at an increasing rate.

The fund has returned 32 paisa on every 1 \\nrupee (or 32%), over five years. Investors would not prefer to stay invested in \\nthe fund for all the five years and seek redemption of capital, before liquidation \\nof the fund. \\n \\nTVPI, DPI and RVPI can be used to compare the fund performance with industry peers. \\n \\nFor the purpose of comparing the performance of Fund ABC with its peers, let us compare its \\nperformance with Fund XYZ, as follows: \\n \\nParticulars \\n2019  \\n2020  \\n2021  \\n2022  \\n2023  \\nFund ABC: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTVPI \\n1.13 \\n1.27 \\n1.50 \\n1.76 \\n2.03 \\nDPI \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n2.03 \\nRVPI  \\n1.13 \\n1.27 \\n1.50 \\n1.76 \\n- \\nFund XYZ: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTVPI \\n1.12 \\n1.31 \\n1.55 \\n1.82 \\n2.01 \\nDPI \\n- \\n0.15 \\n0.33 \\n0.50 \\n2.01 \\nRVPI  \\n1.12 \\n1.16 \\n1.22 \\n1.32 \\n- \\n \\nOn comparison of TVPI, DPI and RVPI of Fund ABC and Fund XYZ, the following can be inferred: \\n \\n• Both funds have constantly increasing TVPI, which is an indicator of above-average \\nfund performance. \\n• Fund XYZ has distributed the assets starting from Year 2 of its operations, which has \\nnot impacted the fund performance, as seen in the increasing RVPI of the fund, in Year \\n2, Year 3 and Year 4. \\n• There is a minimal difference in the TVPI of Fund ABC and Fund XYZ in all the five years. \\nHowever, Fund XYZ has also distributed its assets consistently, which decreases the \\nmarket risk for the investors in the fund.  \\n• On comparison of all the three measures, Fund XYZ is a superior fund for the purpose \\nof investing in the long term. \\n• If the TVPI of Fund ABC would have been substantially higher than TVPI of Fund XYZ, \\nit would have depended on the investors to choose either of the funds, based on their \\nrisk-return profile and time horizon. \\n \\n6.2.2 Types of Risks  \\n \\nA Category III AIF is subject to the following types of risks: \\n193 | P a g e  \\n \\n1. Market Risk \\n \\nFinancial markets are volatile, exhibiting wide swings in market prices. In many instances, \\nmarket prices defy rational analysis of Investment Managers and are influenced by \\nmovements of large funds as a result of short-term factors, counter-speculative measures or \\nother reasons. Market volatility of large enough magnitude can weaken the fundamental \\nbasis for investing in any type of security. Investment expectations may therefore fail to be \\nrealised in such instances.  \\n \\n2. Performance Risk  \\n \\nRisks associated with the investment structure adopted by the Category III AIF. Performance \\nRisk covers the following risk factors: \\n \\n• Potential Loss of Investment \\nProspective investors should be aware that the value of the units of the Fund and the return \\nderived from them may fluctuate. The same applies to the assets in which the Fund will invest. \\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its Investment Objective. As \\nis true of any investment, there is a risk that an investment in the Fund will be lost entirely or \\nin part. The Fund is not a complete investment program and should represent only a portion \\nof an investor\\'s portfolio management strategy. \\n \\nInvestment Managers deploy a fundamental, research-intensive approach to investing. The \\nrisk of such a fundamental analysis is that it may not always result in a profitable outcome \\nbecause the Investment Manager may not know all of the factors affecting a particular \\ninvestment. \\n• Investment Strategy \\nIf the Investment Strategy is speculative, the Investment Manager may seek movements in \\nthe price level or volatility of individual investments, market segments and the financial \\nmarkets as a whole. Successful implementation of this strategy requires accurate assessments \\nof general economic conditions, industry analysis, prospects of individual companies and \\nfuture behaviour of other market participants. The direction of the financial markets is often \\ndriven by unforeseeable economic, political and other events and the reaction of market \\nparticipants to these events. \\n \\nIf there is a change in the Investment Strategy of the Category III AIF, the Investment Manager \\nmay change the allocation of assets within the fund with greater risks. An investment in a \\nCategory III AIF entails a high degree of uncertainty and risk. \\n \\n• Dependence on Investment Manager \\nInvestors subscribing to units of a Category III AIF have no right to participate in the \\nmanagement of the fund. Consequently, they must rely on the Investment Manager with \\n194 | P a g e  \\n \\nrespect to the management and investment decisions of the Fund. If the Investment Manager \\ncannot continue to manage the Fund, due to bankruptcy or dissolution, the Fund may have \\nto be dissolved. Further, if members of the key investment team cease to provide their \\ninvestment expertise to the Investment Manager, the quality of the investment management \\nservices provided to the Fund may be adversely affected. In such cases, it might not be \\npossible to realize the full value of the investments. \\nThe information available to an Investment Manager, at the time of an investment decision, \\nmay be limited, and the Investment Manager may not have access to all the necessary \\ninformation, to analyse a potential investment opportunity. Hence, no assurance can be given \\nthat the Investment Manager will have knowledge of all relevant circumstances that may \\nadversely affect an investment. Moreover, the Investment Manager may rely upon \\ninvestment advice given by independent consultants, in connection with the evaluation of \\nproposed investments. \\n• Incentive Fee \\nThe Investment Manager may choose to make investments that are riskier or more \\nspeculative in comparison with the investment objectives of the Category III AIF, in order to \\nearn higher Incentive Fees.  \\n• Liquidity and Realisation of Investment \\nCategory III AIFs are relatively illiquid investments, as compared to investments in equity \\nsecurities of listed companies. There is no secondary market for the units of the Fund. \\nDepending on the Fund Structure, an investor may not be able to dispose-off or realise the \\ninvestment in the Fund at the preferred time of exit. \\n• Concentration Risk \\nAlthough the Investment Managers of Category III AIFs follow a general policy of diversifying \\nthe investments, the Fund may at certain times hold only a few relatively large (in relation to \\nits capital) positions. This means that a loss in any position could have a material adverse \\nimpact on the investments of the fund. To avoid the risk of concentration, SEBI has restricted \\nthe maximum exposure of a Category III AIF to one security, which is up to a limit of 10 percent \\nof investable funds in an Investee Company directly or through investment in units of other \\nAlternative Investment Funds. However, large value funds for accredited investors of \\nCategory III AIFs may invest up to twenty percent of the investable funds in an investee \\ncompany directly or through investment in units of other Alternative Investment Funds. \\n• Distribution or Repatriation of Income \\nDistribution of all sources of income generated by the Category III AIF is not guaranteed by \\nthe Investment Manager, at regular intervals. If the Category III AIF has foreign investors, it \\nmay not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest and other income \\n195 | P a g e  \\n \\nfrom India, or it may require government or regulatory consent or comply with legal \\nformalities to do so. The Fund’s investment may also be affected by developments relating \\nto or restrictions under exchange control regulations.  \\n• Co-investments \\nA Category III AIF may invest in assets through joint ventures or other co-investment \\nstructures with other parties. Such investments may have joint and several liabilities for the \\nfund or a higher liability in comparison with the Fund\\'s pro rata investment in the deal. \\nAccordingly, the Fund may as a result of an act or omission of a third party investor suffer a \\nloss higher than the Fund\\'s pro rata share in the relevant investment. \\n• Geo-Political Risks \\nUncertainties arising from war, recent world pandemic, threat of terrorism, on-going military \\nincluding heightened security measures, international tensions and the outbreak of \\ninfectious diseases throughout the world may cause disruptions to commerce, reduced \\neconomic activity, and continued volatility in markets throughout the world. Some of the \\nassets in the Category III AIF\\'s portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the \\nsecurities markets and economic activities because of these factors.  \\nThe Fund may incur significant losses in the event of disrupted markets and other \\nextraordinary events in which historical pricing relationship, for the investments made, \\nbecomes materially distorted. The risk of loss from pricing distortions is compounded as \\nmany positions become illiquid, making it difficult to close out positions. \\nIt is difficult to predict whether any additional interim or permanent governmental steps \\nmay be taken and what effect such steps may have on the Fund\\'s investment strategies.  \\n3. Counterparty Risk \\n \\nA Category III AIF transacts most of the investments through financial institutions including, \\nbut not limited to, brokers, dealers, banks, NBFCS, and distributors. All transactions will carry \\ncounterparty risks until the transactions have settled. All deposits of securities or cash with \\na custodian, bank or financial institution will carry counterparty risk. Upon default by \\ncounterparty, the Fund may be forced to unwind certain transactions and the Fund may \\nencounter delays and difficulties with respect to court procedures in seeking recovery of the \\nFund\\'s assets. \\n4. Funding Risk  \\n \\nCapital commitments are made by investors to the Category III AIF manager and capital \\ncontributions are made once the capital call is made by the Investment Manager. It is possible \\nthat some investor may not honour subsequent capital calls either on account of inability or \\n196 | P a g e  \\n \\ndue to poor fund performance. Such events can distort the timing of cash flows for the \\nInvestment Manager and impact the expected return of the Fund. \\n \\n5. Interest Rate Risk \\n \\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect the investments made by the Category III AIF \\nand the income earned thereon, by affecting the spread between interest income and \\nexpenditure.  \\n \\nMacro-economic factors such as governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and \\ninternational economic and political considerations, fiscal deficits, trade surpluses or deficits \\nand other regulatory requirements may substantially impact the Net Asset Value of the \\nCategory III AIF. Furthermore, due to interest rate changes, funds employing a hedging \\nstrategy may not be able to implement the strategy and find a perfect hedge against their \\nrisk.  \\n \\n6. Foreign Exchange Risk \\n \\nForeign exchange trading risks include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, interest \\nrate risk and potential interference by the Indian regulators through regulation of local \\nexchange markets, foreign investment, or particular transactions in foreign currency. \\n7. Operational Risk \\n \\nOperational risk is the risk of losses occurring because of inadequate systems and control, \\nhuman error, or management failure. The complexity of certain investment products requires \\nspecial emphasis on maintaining adequate human and systems controls to validate and \\nmonitor the transactions. The information systems or facilities used by the Fund may be \\nsusceptible to employee error or malfeasance, surveillance or other security threats.  \\n \\nA Category III AIF needs to have adequate business continuity plans and disaster recovery \\nplans for its operations, as it relies heavily on third-parties such as sub-advisors or fund \\nadministrator. Such key third parties also, in turn, need to have adequate business continuity \\nplans and disaster recovery plans to limit any loss of data or resources. \\n \\n8. Cyber Security Risk \\n \\nAs part of business, a Category III AIF will process, store and transmit large amounts of \\nelectronic information, including information relating to the transactions of the Fund and \\npersonal identifiable information of the investors. Similarly, service providers of the Fund will \\nprocess, store and transmit such information. With the increased use of technology, \\ninvestment vehicles and their service providers may be prone to information security risks \\nresulting from cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks include stealing or corrupting data maintained \\n197 | P a g e  \\n \\nonline or digitally, denial-of-service attacks on websites, unauthorized release of confidential \\ninformation and causing operational disruption. \\nA Category III AIF should have adequate internal procedures and systems in place to protect \\nsuch information and prevent data loss and security breaches. However, such procedures \\ncannot provide absolute security. It may be difficult to detect the techniques used to obtain \\nunauthorized access to data.  \\n \\nHardware or software acquired through third parties may contain defects in design or other \\nproblems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Network connected \\nservices provided by third parties to the Fund may be susceptible to compromise, leading to \\na breach of information. On-line services provided by the Fund, or any of their service \\nproviders may also be susceptible to compromise. \\n \\n9. Country-specific Risks \\n \\nA Category III AIF may be adversely affected by potential political and social uncertainties in \\nany emerging market economy.  \\n \\nHigh inflation may lead to the adoption of corrective measures designed to moderate growth, \\nregulate prices of staples and other commodities which could inhibit economic activity in \\nIndia and possibly affect the Fund. \\n \\n10. Legal and Regulatory Risks \\n \\nRegulatory reforms in the Alternative Investments Market by Securities Exchange Board of \\nIndia (SEBI), along-with related reforms by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Ministry of Finance, \\nCentral Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and other regulatory authorities could significantly \\nand/or adversely affect the value of investments made by the Category III AIFs, in India or \\noutside India.  \\n \\nLegal and Regulatory Risk covers the following risk factors: \\n \\n• Regulatory Approvals \\nCertain Indian regulatory approvals, including those of SEBI, the central government and the \\ntax authorities, are required before the Category III AIF can make investments in Indian \\nportfolio companies. In addition, the Fund requires the prior approval of the Ministry of \\nCommerce and Industry and the Reserve Bank of India to invest beyond certain specified \\nequity ceilings in certain Indian portfolio companies. \\n \\nThe Sponsor of the Fund also requires certain approvals from regulatory authorities in the \\nrespective jurisdiction. If policy changes, announcements or regulations are made in the \\njurisdiction, it may adversely impact the performance of the Fund. \\n \\n \\n \\n198 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Tax Rates \\nInvestors in the Fund are subject to a number of risks related to tax matters. There has been \\nuncertainty in the Tax laws and Tax structures for Category III AIFs, which impacts the tax \\nliabilities and net returns of the investors. Alternative tax positions adopted by the income \\ntax authorities could give rise to incremental tax liabilities in addition to the tax amounts \\nalready discharged by the Fund. Higher tax flows also impact future distributions to the \\ninvestors, made by the Fund. \\n \\n11. Reputational Risk \\n \\nIf the Investment Manager of a Category III AIF is unable to raise sufficient capital for a \\nsuccessful First Close or Final close, the existing investors may not wish to make further capital \\ncontributions to the fund due to lack of reputation in the market. Similarly, if the Investment \\nManager has delivered below-average returns and distributions to the existing investors in \\none fund, it can deteriorate the reputation of the Investment Manager and make it difficult \\nfor the Investment Manager to raise capital for a subsequent fund. \\n \\n12. Leverage Risk \\n \\nInvestment Manager of a Category III AIF is permitted to take leverage, as per the prudential \\nnorms set-forth by SEBI which is currently two times the NAV of the fund. Investment \\nManagers should not take excess leverage, which increases the inherent risk of the fund’s \\ninvestments, on account of positions in derivative contracts. Adequate internal controls \\nshould be implemented at the fund level to ensure compliance with the prudential norms and \\nreporting any breach of leverage limits specified by SEBI, on a monthly basis if the fund is \\ntaking leverage. \\n \\n13. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Risk \\n \\nAll Alternative Investment Funds shall mandatorily follow a Stewardship Code in relation to \\ntheir investment in listed equities.124 The Investment Manager of a Category III AIF should \\nensure that they have adequate internal controls, processes and systems to ensure that the \\nfund can successfully follow the Stewardship Code, from Financial Year 2020-21 onwards. \\nFurthermore, the Investment Manager should ensure that the Fund makes a periodic report \\navailable to SEBI, as well as to its clients and beneficiaries, on its Stewardship activities. If the \\nInvestment Manager is not successfully following the Stewardship Code, as part of its internal \\nprocess, it provides a bad signal to potential institutional clients looking to invest in the fund. \\n6.2.3 Risk Metrics  \\n \\nRisk Factors disclosed in the Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) of a Category III AIF are \\ndiscussed above. Investors should ascertain the inherent risk of the Fund, by analysing past \\n                                                          \\n \\n124 SEBI Circular No.: CIR/CFD/CMD1/168/2019 dated December 24, 2019 on Stewardship Code for all Mutual \\nFunds and all categories of AIFs, in relation to their investment in listed equities. \\n199 | P a g e  \\n \\nperformance of the fund or the manager. However, certain risks are not measurable, such as \\nmacro-economic risk, legal and regulatory risk, operational risk, country-specific risk and \\ncyber security risks. Some of the common risk measures used to analyse the inherent risk of \\na Category III AIF are as under: \\n6.2.3.1 Standard Deviation \\n \\nStandard Deviation is one of the most common measures used to  measure historical risk of \\nthe fund, using the historical returns. Standard Deviation measures the volatility of return \\nmeasures, from the mean return. Since volatility of the historical returns is measured in \\nStandard Deviation, it is used to ascertain the historical risk of the fund. \\n \\n \\nStandard Deviation   =   𝛔  =   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere: \\nRi – Return achieved in year i \\nR – Mean Return of the Fund (see Box 6.1) \\nn – Total number of years taken into consideration \\ni – Every Year for which the return is achieved \\n \\nIn present day, risk measures such as Standard Deviation can be easily computed using \\ncomputer software, financial calculators and online websites. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLet us understand the calculation of Standard Deviation with the help of an example: \\n \\n \\n \\n√∑(𝑅𝑖−\\uf060𝑅)\\n𝟐\\n𝑛\\n \\n \\nBox 6.1: Mean \\nMean is the average of the historical returns of the fund. Investors will prefer a higher \\nMean of the historical returns, which signifies increased returns generated by the fund \\nhistorically. Mathematically, mean is represented as: \\nMean (\\uf060R ) = \\n∑𝑹i\\n𝑛 \\nWhere, \\nRi – Return achieved in year i \\nn – Total number of years taken into consideration \\ni – Every Year for which the return is achieved \\n200 | P a g e  \\n \\nExample 8: Calculation of Mean and Standard Deviation: \\n \\nThe following table shows the historical returns earned by two Category III AIFs: \\n \\nParticulars \\n Year 1  \\n Year 2  \\n Year 3  \\n Year 4  \\n Year 5  \\nFund A  \\n12.50% \\n11.25% \\n13.65% \\n17.30% \\n14.65% \\nFund B  \\n21.50% \\n-0.50% \\n16.75% \\n20.25% \\n21.90% \\n \\nCalculate the Mean and Standard Deviation for the Fund. \\nAnswer: \\n \\nMean (Fund A)  =  12.50 + 11.25 + 13.65 + 17.30 + 14.65   =  13.87% \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\nMean (Fund B)  =  21.50 – 0.50 + 16.75 + 20.25 + 21.90     =  15.98% \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\nStandard Deviation is computed taking Mean as computed above: \\n \\nFund A 𝛔 = \\n√(12.50−13.87)2+ (11.25−13.87)2 + (13.65−13.87)2 + (17.30−13.87)2 + (14.65−13.87)2\\n5\\n \\n \\nFund A 𝛔   =    2.06% \\n \\nFund B 𝛔   =    \\n√(21.50−15.98)2+ (−0.50−15.98)2 + (16.75−15.98)2 + (20.25−15.98)2 + (21.90−15.98)2\\n5\\n \\n \\nFund B𝛔   =    8.44% \\n \\nFrom the above risk measures, we can infer that Fund A has generated low returns, as \\ncompared to Fund B. However, the inherent risk of Fund B is much higher as compared to the \\ninherent risk of Fund A. Hence, a prudent investor will choose Fund A over Fund B. \\n \\n6.2.3.2 Skewness and Kurtosis \\n \\nSkewness and Kurtosis are two important risk measures for a Category III AIF. In order to \\nunderstand and analyse these risk measures it is important to know the concept of normal \\ndistribution, though Category III AIFs do not necessarily follow a normal distribution. \\n \\nNormal Distribution: \\n \\nThe normal distribution, or the “bell-shaped” curve, is commonly applied for statistical \\nanalysis of data and interpreting the inherent risk of a security. A normal distribution is \\nperfectly symmetrical when divided in two halves by the mean of the data interpreted. The \\nfrequency of each observation in the data set is shown in the curve, across the mean. The \\n201 | P a g e  \\n \\nvalues above the mean appear on the right-hand side of the mean and the curve. Similarly, \\nvalues below the mean or negative vales appear on the left-hand side of the mean. The values \\nare distributed based on how many standard deviations (σ) away is the value, from the mean.  \\n \\nLet us understand the concept of normal distribution through an example.  \\n \\nExample 9: Normal Distribution: \\n \\nThe following table shows the mean and standard deviation of 5-year return of two Category \\nIII AIFs: \\n \\nParticulars \\nMean \\nStandard Deviation \\n Fund A  \\n13.87% \\n2.06% \\n Fund B  \\n15.98% \\n8.44% \\n \\nThe following table shows the historical returns earned by two Category III AIFs: \\n \\nParticulars \\n Year 1  \\n Year 2  \\n Year 3  \\n Year 4  \\n Year 5  \\n Fund A  \\n12.50% \\n11.25% \\n13.65% \\n17.30% \\n14.65% \\n Fund B  \\n21.50% \\n-0.50% \\n16.75% \\n20.25% \\n21.90% \\n \\nAnalyse the data using a Normal Distribution. \\n \\nSolution:  \\nThe data set of the historical returns can be plotted on the Normal Distribution to interpret \\nthe inherent risks. \\n \\nExhibit 1: Normal Distribution – Fund A \\n \\n0\\n0.05\\n0.1\\n0.15\\n0.2\\n0.25\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n12\\n14\\n16\\n18\\n20\\n22\\n1 𝛔\\n1 𝛔\\n13.87%\\n202 | P a g e  \\n \\nAs seen from the exhibit, the Mean of Fund A, which is 13.87%, is the centre line of the Normal \\nDistribution, with 50% of the return values on the left of the mean and 50% of the return \\nvalues on the right of the mean. \\n \\nThe Normal Distribution shown in Exhibit 1 is constructed by taking increments of 3 σ of the \\nvalue of returns, towards the left and right side of the mean.  \\n \\nMean +/- 1 𝛔 represent 68% of the total returns being observed \\nMean +/- 2 𝛔 represent 95% of the total returns being observed \\n \\nIt can be observed from the table, that three out of five returns are in the range of 1 𝛔 towards \\nthe right of the mean plus 1 𝛔  towards the left of the mean. \\n \\nExhibit 2: Normal Distribution – Fund B \\n \\n \\n \\nAs seen from the exhibit, the Mean of Fund B, which is 15.98%, is the centre line of the Normal \\nDistribution, with 50% of the return values on the left of the mean and 50% of the return \\nvalues on the right of the mean. The Normal Distribution shown in Exhibit 2 is constructed by \\ntaking increments of 3 σ of the value of returns, towards the left and right side of the mean.  \\n \\nIn Year 2, the fund had generated a negative return of -0.50%. Due to this return, the normal \\ndistribution curve moves beyond the y-axis, to represent the negative return as an outlier. \\n \\nOutliers are extreme returns, whether highly positive or highly negative returns. Prudent \\ninvestors would never prefer historical performance of a fund to exhibit outliers, as it signifies \\nincreased market risk and a volatile fund strategy.  \\n \\nTo interpret the effect of outliers, risk measures of Skewness and Kurtosis are important. \\n \\n \\n \\n0\\n0.005\\n0.01\\n0.015\\n0.02\\n0.025\\n0.03\\n0.035\\n0.04\\n0.045\\n0.05\\n-15\\n-5\\n5\\n15\\n25\\n35\\n15.98%\\n1𝛔\\n1𝛔\\n203 | P a g e  \\n \\nSkewness \\n \\nAs discussed above, the normal distribution is the distribution of the frequency of each data \\npoint appearing within the curve. Mode is the highest frequency of any data point. Hence, \\nthe point where the curve is at its peak is the Mode for that Distribution. In a Normal \\nDistribution, the Mode and the Mean are at the same point, where the distribution is peaked.  \\nSkewness, or skew, refers to the extent to which a distribution is not symmetrical across the \\nmean. Skewness is a result of outliers, either above or below the mean. Although, outliers \\nabove the mean are sometimes beneficial, investors must be diligent of the outliers lying \\nbelow the mean. For this purpose, we calculate the Skewness of a distribution and compare \\nthe skewness value to that of a Normal Distribution. Since a Normal Distribution is perfectly \\nsymmetrical, it has a Skewness of Zero. \\nA positively skewed distribution is skewed right, due to large outliers on the positive side and \\nabove the mean. Due to positive outliers, the distribution may have a relatively long right tail, \\nas compared to the normal distribution. \\nIn a positively skewed distribution, the mean shifts away from the mode, as a new positive \\noutlier (return) is added to the set of returns. If a high return is added to the data set, the \\nmean is set to increase. Hence, the Mean is always higher than the Mode, in a positively \\nskewed distribution. \\nA negatively skewed distribution is skewed left, due to large outliers below the mean or on \\nthe negative side. Due to negative outliers, the distribution may have a relatively long left tail, \\nas compared to the normal distribution. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean shifts \\nbelow the mode, as a new outlier is added which is below the mean. Hence, the Mean is \\nalways lesser than the Mode, in a negatively skewed distribution. \\nA distribution having Skewness of greater than zero indicates a positively skewed distribution \\nand a distribution having Skewness of less than zero indicates a negatively skewed \\ndistribution. Skewness, in itself, is an important risk measure to check the extent of outliers \\nin the returns of the fund. While the investors will not prefer the distribution of returns to be \\nskewed, Positive Skewness is preferred over Negative Skewness. \\nLet us understand Skewness, by continuing the example of Fund A and Fund B: \\nExample 9.1: Skewness: \\n \\nReturns of Year 6 are added to the historical performance of Fund A and Fund B: \\n \\nParticulars \\n Year 1   Year 2   Year 3   Year 4   Year 5   Year 6 \\n Fund A  \\n12.50% 11.25% 13.65% \\n17.30% 14.65% 13.85% \\n Fund B  \\n21.50% \\n-0.50% 16.75% \\n20.25% 21.90% 20.80% \\n204 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars \\nMean \\nStandard Deviation \\n Fund A  \\n13.87% \\n1.88% \\n Fund B  \\n16.78% \\n7.91% \\n \\nCalculate the Skewness of Fund A and Fund B and interpret the results. \\nSolution: \\nSkewness can be calculated in Microsoft Excel, using the “Skew” Function, as under: \\n=SKEW(range)  \\nwhere range is the range of returns earned by a fund, over any number of periods. \\nCalculating Skewness of returns for the funds, we get the following data: \\nParticulars \\nMean \\nStandard Deviation \\nSkewness \\n \\n Net Returns - Fund A  \\n13.87% \\n1.88% \\n0.705 \\n \\n Net Returns - Fund B  \\n16.78% \\n7.91% \\n-2.222 \\n \\n \\nAs seen from the above data, Fund A exhibits Positive Skewness and Fund B exhibits Negative \\nSkewness. On comparison of risk based on Skewness, Fund B is riskier than Fund A. This is also \\nsummarized in the following exhibits: \\nExhibit 3: Positive Skewness – Fund A \\n \\n \\n0\\n0.05\\n0.1\\n0.15\\n0.2\\n0.25\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\nMean\\nMode \\n205 | P a g e  \\n \\nAs seen from Exhibit 3, the returns of Fund A exhibit Positive Skewness. The distribution is \\nasymmetrical due to positive outliers and more values in the right tail. Due to positive outliers, \\nthe Mean is greater than the Mode of the Distribution. \\nSince the value of the positive outliers is not significantly higher than the mean, the Fund is \\nnot a risky investment, as compared to Fund B. \\nExhibit 4: Negative Skewness – Fund B \\n \\n \\nAs seen from Exhibit 4, the returns of Fund B exhibit Negative Skewness. The distribution is \\nasymmetrical due to negative outliers and more values in the left tail. Since the Fund has \\nnegative outliers as well as positive outliers, it is possible that the Mean is not significantly \\ndifferent from the Mode of the Distribution. However, due to Negative Skewness, Fund B is a \\nrisky investment, as compared to Fund A. \\nKurtosis \\nKurtosis refers to the degree to which a distribution is more or less peaked than a normal \\ndistribution. If a distribution is peaked, it indicates the presence of outliers with large \\ndeviations from the mean. Kurtosis is calculated to check the level of “peakedness” of the \\ndistribution. A Normal Distribution has a Kurtosis of Three. Therefore, a distribution with a \\nKurtosis above 3 is considered riskier, in its comparison with the normal distribution, as it \\nrepresents an Excess Kurtosis greater than zero (excess of kurtosis value over 3). \\nLeptokurtic Distributions have a Kurtosis higher than 3, or Excess Kurtosis greater than zero.  \\nSuch distributions have data values which are either around the mean or substantially \\ndeviating away from the Mean.  \\nPlatykurtic Distributions have a Kurtosis below 3, or Excess Kurtosis less than zero. Such \\ndistributions have data values with consistent frequencies around the mean and no significant \\ndeviations. \\n0\\n0.01\\n0.02\\n0.03\\n0.04\\n0.05\\n0.06\\n-20\\n-15\\n-10\\n-5\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n206 | P a g e  \\n \\nKurtosis measures the level of deviations of data values, from its means. Distributions having \\nfatter tails and higher peaks will have a high kurtosis. Investors must be diligent about funds \\nexhibiting return distributions with fatter tails, as it is an indicator of inconsistent \\nperformance.  \\nLet us understand Kurtosis, by continuing the example of Fund A and Fund B: \\nExample 9.2: Kurtosis: \\n \\nReturns of Fund A and Fund B are as under: \\n \\nParticulars \\n Year 1   Year 2   Year 3   Year 4   Year 5   Year 6 \\n Fund A  \\n12.50% 11.25% 13.65% \\n17.30% 14.65% 13.85% \\nFund B  \\n21.50% \\n-0.50% 16.75% \\n20.25% 21.90% 20.80% \\n \\nParticulars \\nMean \\nStandard Deviation \\n Fund A  \\n13.87% \\n1.88% \\n Fund B  \\n16.78% \\n7.91% \\n \\nCalculate the Kurtosis of Fund A and Fund B and interpret the results. \\nSolution: \\nKurtosis can be calculated in Microsoft Excel, using the “Kurt” Function as under:  \\n=KURT(range)  \\nwhere range is the range of returns earned by a fund, over any number of periods. \\nCalculating Kurtosis of returns for the funds, we get the following data: \\nParticulars \\nMean \\nStandard Deviation \\nSkewness Kurtosis \\n Fund A  \\n13.87% \\n1.88% \\n0.705 \\n1.162 \\n Fund B  \\n16.78% \\n7.91% \\n-2.222 \\n5.034 \\n \\nAs seen from the above data, Fund A exhibits Negative excess Kurtosis and Fund B exhibits \\nPositive excess Kurtosis, as follows: \\nFund A: 1.162 – 3.000 = -1.838 \\nFund B: 5.034 – 3.000 = 2.034 \\n207 | P a g e  \\n \\nOn comparison of risk based on Kurtosis, Fund B is riskier compared to Fund A.  \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\nOn analyzing the Fund Performance and Risk Measures of Fund A and Fund B, it is observed \\nthat risk measures such as Standard Deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis have concluded that \\nFund B is riskier than Fund A. However, it is important for sophisticated investors to not \\nanalyze all the risk measures in isolation.  \\n \\nOn independent analysis of Mean and Standard Deviation of Fund A and Fund B, an investor \\nhaving a high risk appetite may still invest in Fund B, after analyzing the mean and standard \\ndeviation. However, without analyzing the Skewness and Kurtosis of the Funds, such investor \\nwould ignore the probability of outliers and volatility of expected returns of the funds. \\nIncreased analysis of risk measures can significantly influence investment decisions of \\ninvestors, especially in illiquid assets such as Category III AIFs. \\n \\n6.2.4 Risk-adjusted Return Metrics and Performance Measures \\n \\nRisk-adjusted performance measures allow investors to compare the returns of a Category III \\nAIF, adjusted for the risk level of a benchmark. The following measures can be useful for \\ninvestors to compare the performance of a Category III AIF with its peers and for investment \\nmanagers to summarize the risk and return characteristics of the fund. \\n \\n6.2.4.1 Sharpe Ratio \\n \\nThe Sharpe ratio calculates how the Category III AIF compensates an investor for the risk \\nthey’ve taken by investing in the fund. The Sharpe Ratio computes the excess return earned \\nby the fund over the risk-free rate, per unit of total risk taken as defined by its portfolio \\nstandard deviation. The returns from a risk-free security such as T-bills or Government \\nSecurities are commonly used as the risk-free rate, for the purpose of computing the Sharpe \\nRatio. \\n \\nWhen comparing two different investments against the same benchmark, the asset with the \\nhigher Sharpe ratio provides a higher return for the same amount of risk or the same return \\nfor a lower risk than the other asset. Sharpe ratios greater than 1 are preferable. Investors \\nprefer a higher Sharpe ratio for a better risk-adjusted return from the fund. \\n \\nSharpe Ratio=    \\nRp− Rf\\nσp  \\nwhere: \\nRp  = Expected Portfolio Return  \\nRf   = Risk-free Return \\nσp   = Portfolio Standard Deviation \\n \\n208 | P a g e  \\n \\n6.2.4.2 Treynor Ratio \\n \\nThe Treynor ratio computes the excess return earned by the fund over the risk-free rate, per \\nunit of the Systematic risk taken by the fund, as defined by its portfolio Beta, which is not \\ndiversifiable. \\n \\nIf the ratio shows a high value, it means the investment offers a relatively high return with \\nthe inclusion of market risks. The Treynor ratio is based on the premise that the risk premium \\ngenerated by an investment manager of a Category III AIF should not be compared with the \\ntotal risk, but with the risk which is not diversifiable. \\n \\nTreynor Ratio=    \\nRp− Rf\\n𝛽\\n \\n \\nwhere: \\nRp  = Expected Portfolio Return  \\nRf   = Risk-free Return \\n𝛽    = Portfolio Beta \\n \\nFor performance measurement of well-diversified portfolios, the Treynor Ratio and Sharpe \\nRatio may provide identical results as the total risk may be similar to the systematic risk of \\nthe portfolio. However, for undiversified portfolios, the results are likely to differ. Therefore, \\non comparison of undiversified portfolios, investors should prefer to use the Sharpe Ratio \\nover Treynor Ratio. \\n \\n \\nExample 10: \\n \\nThe following table shows the performance data for the 5 funds managed by Investment \\nManager PQC: \\n \\nParticulars \\nGrowth \\nDiversified \\nLong-only \\nLong-short \\nDirectional \\nExpected Returns (Rp) \\n24.50% \\n13.25% \\n15.75% \\n19.30% \\n14.65% \\nStandard Deviation (σp) \\n3.35% \\n1.05% \\n2.15% \\n2.26% \\n1.96% \\nBeta (β) \\n3.50 \\n1.01 \\n1.82 \\n1.95 \\n1.73 \\n364-day T-bill rate (Rf) \\n5.60 % \\n \\nCalculate the Sharpe Ratio and Treynor Ratio for the funds. Analyse the results. \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nParticulars \\n Growth  \\nDiversified \\nLong-only \\nLong-short \\nDirectional \\nSharpe Ratio \\n[(Rp - Rf)/𝛔𝐩] \\n5.64 \\n7.29 \\n4.72 \\n6.06 \\n4.62 \\n209 | P a g e  \\n \\nTreynor Ratio \\n[(Rp - Rf)/𝛃] \\n5.40 \\n7.57 \\n5.58 \\n7.03 \\n5.23 \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• For the Diversified Portfolio, it is observed that the Sharpe Ratio and the Treynor \\nRatio results are almost identical, as the Beta is almost equal to the total risk of the \\nfund, i.e. the standard deviation. \\n \\n• Analysis of Sharpe Ratio and Treynor Ratio provides further analysis for an investor \\nin the funds. On comparison of the performance of the Growth fund and the Long-\\nshort fund, returns of the Growth fund are higher, however, the Sharpe Ratio and \\nthe Treynor Ratio are high for the Long-short fund on account of the lower risk. \\n \\n6.2.4.3 Maximum Drawdown \\n \\nMaximum drawdown (MDD) is the peak-to-trough decline in the Assets under Management \\n(AUM) of a Category III AIF, during a specific reporting period. It is usually quoted as a \\npercentage of the peak value, or the highest AUM, achieved by the fund in the reporting \\nperiod.  \\n \\nMDD = \\n(𝐓𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞\\u200a—\\u200a𝐏𝐞𝐚𝐤 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞)\\n𝐏𝐞𝐚𝐤 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞\\n \\n \\nMaximum drawdown measures the extent of the greatest loss in a portfolio, until a new peak \\nvalue is created. However, it does not take into consideration how often the portfolio \\nexperiences large losses and it does not indicate the length of time it shall take an investor to \\nbe able to recover the loss. \\n \\nIt is important to use Maximum Drawdown with the right perspective. Although investors \\nwould prefer a zero value of the maximum drawdown, it is important to pay attention to the \\ntime period being considered in the reporting period and the performance of a benchmark \\nover the same time period.  \\n \\nExample 11: \\n \\nThe following table shows the performance data for the Fund PQR and NIFTY50 for the \\nquarter ending March 31, 2020: \\n \\nParticulars \\nJanuary \\n01, 2020 \\nJanuary \\n15, 2020 \\nFebruary \\n01, 2020 \\nFebruary \\n14, 2020 \\nMarch \\n01, 2020 \\nMarch \\n23, 2020 \\nMarch \\n31, 2020 \\nFUND PQR \\n(AUM in  \\nRs. crore) \\n560.45 \\n585.96 \\n584.23 \\n632.33 \\n596.29 \\n564.35 \\n545.61 \\nNIFTY50 \\n12202.15 12430.50 11661.85 12113.45 11132.75 7610.25 \\n8597.75 \\n210 | P a g e  \\n \\n(Index \\nValue) \\n \\nCompute the Maximum Drawdown for Fund PQR. Analyse the results, assuming NIFTY50 is \\nan appropriate benchmark for Fund PQR. \\nSolution: \\n \\nParticulars \\nFund PQR \\n(Rs. crore) \\nNIFTY50 \\nTrough Value \\n545.61 \\n7610.25 \\nPeak Value \\n632.33 \\n12430.50 \\nMaximum Drawdown \\n[(Trough Value–Peak Value)/Peak Value] \\n-13.71% \\n-38.78% \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• Although the Maximum Drawdown for Fund PQR is high at -13.71%, it is much lower \\nthan Maximum Drawdown for its benchmark, NIFTY50, which is -38.78%.  \\n \\n• This shows that even when capital markets were facing the downside risk125, due to \\nexternal factors, the downside risk for Fund PQR was lower than the downside risk \\nfor the overall market.  \\n \\n6.2.4.4 Value at Risk  \\n \\nValue at Risk (VaR) is a measure used to quantify the downside risk in a Category III AIF. VaR \\nis defined as the maximum amount of expected loss for a fund, over a given time frame and \\na pre-defined confidence level.  \\n \\nFor example, if the 95% one-month VAR of Fund XYZ is Rs. 1 crore, there is 95% probability \\nthat over the next month, the fund will not lose more than Rs. 1 crore. Conversely, it can be \\nsaid that there is a 95% probability that the maximum loss for Fund XYZ, over the next month, \\nwill be up to Rs. 1 crore. \\n \\nVaR modelling helps to determine the potential for loss and the probability of occurrence of \\nsuch loss over a defined timeframe. Investors would prefer a VaR to be close to zero for any \\nCategory III AIF. However, given the inherent market risks faced by every Category III AIF, \\ninvestors should choose to invest in the fund with lowest VaR over a defined time period.  \\n \\nVAR has a number of limitations. While quantifying the maximum potential loss, it fails to \\nindicate the size of the loss to be borne by the fund, upon a certain event and based on a \\ndefined confidence level. \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n125 Downside Risk is the probability of a loss on account of reducing asset prices in changing market conditions. \\n211 | P a g e  \\n \\n6.3 Performance Benchmarking \\n \\nPerformance Benchmarking is a crucial process for investors to monitor the returns generated \\nby a Category III AIF, on an on-going basis. Performance Benchmarking can also be used for \\ncomparison of the returns generated by the Category III AIF with the returns generated by \\nother comparable funds. \\n \\nBenchmark is the comparable fund or index having similar risk return characteristics as the \\nCategory III AIF being monitored. Benchmark Return is the return generated by the chosen \\nbenchmark, over the reporting period.  \\n \\nA Category III AIF defines an investment strategy in its Private Placement Memorandum \\n(PPM), which is specifically followed by its Investment Manager. Due to different investment \\nstrategies followed across Category III AIFs which may invest across varying asset classes, \\nderivative contracts or by taking varying level of leverage, it is difficult to construct a \\nbenchmark for every Category III AIF, in the Indian Alternative Investment Market.  \\n \\nIn such a scenario, the Investment Manager can benchmark the fund performance against a \\nbroad-market index, depending on the market-cap of the securities in which the fund \\nprimarily invests. The Investment Strategy followed by the Investment Manager outlines the \\ntargeted market sectors and market-cap of companies in which the fund may primarily invest. \\nWith the detailed investment strategy, an investor may choose to benchmark the fund \\nperformance against the most appropriate broad-based market indices, published by \\nNational Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange of India (BSE). Such index \\nreturns can be used as an indicative benchmark, if not a perfect benchmark, to monitor and \\ncompare the performance of a Category III AIF. \\n \\nSome Category III AIFs follow an ‘absolute-return’ strategy, which aims at making \\ninvestments, independent from the broad market movements. Such funds invest through \\nleveraged positions, concentrated positions, long/short positions or market neutral positions \\nin equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, index derivatives and other unconventional \\ninvestment methodologies.  \\n \\nThe benchmark for ‘absolute-return’ strategies may be fixed rate, pre-determined by the \\nInvestment Manager at the time of launching the fund scheme, such as 10 percent per annum. \\nAbsolute Returns are not benchmarked against a broad-based market index or a relative \\nbenchmark. Returns for the fund are then computed every year, using the risk-return \\nmeasures discussed in this chapter. If the yearly returns are more than the pre-determined \\nrate specified by the investment manager, the fund is said to have over-performed in that \\nyear, and vice-versa. The computation of returns may be done on shorter reporting intervals \\nas well, such as monthly or quarterly. \\n \\n \\n \\n212 | P a g e  \\n \\nExample 12: Benchmarking: \\n \\nFollowing are extracts provided from the PPM of three funds, Fund X, Fund Y and Fund Z. \\nInterpret the investment strategy and suggest a suitable benchmark for the Funds, with a \\nrationale. \\n \\nParticulars \\nFund X \\nFund Y \\nFund Z \\nInvestment Strategy Equity Long-only \\nMarket-Neutral \\nLong-only \\nFund Tenure \\n3 years \\n5 years \\n7 years \\nType of Securities \\nListed Equities \\nUnlisted Equities \\nand Listed Equities \\nListed Equities, \\nListed SMEs and \\nUnlisted SMEs \\nMarket-cap of \\nTarget Companies \\nLarge-cap \\nCompanies  \\nMid-cap Companies \\nSmall-cap \\nCompanies and \\nSMEs \\nTarget Allocation \\n100% - Listed \\nEquities \\n80% - Listed Equities \\n20% - Unlisted \\nEquities \\n50% - Listed Equities \\n25% - Listed SMEs \\n25% - Unlisted SMEs \\nTarget Sectors \\nSector-agnostic \\n20% - Unlisted BFSI \\n20% - Listed FMCG \\n20% - Listed Pharma \\n10% - Listed Realty \\n10% - Listed Metal \\n20% - Listed IT \\nSector-agnostic \\nLeverage \\nIndex Options \\nNo Leverage \\nNo Leverage \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nFund X: AIF X is investing primarily in Large-cap listed companies. Hence, the appropriate \\nbenchmark can be either of the following: \\n \\n• NIFTY 50 \\n• S&P BSE SENSEX \\n• NIFTY Next 50 \\n• S&P BSE Next 50 \\n• NIFTY 100 \\n• S&P BSE 100 \\n \\nInvestors can choose the appropriate benchmark, based on actual investments made and the \\nmarket-cap of the securities. If the Fund is investing in blue-chip stocks only, then NIFTY 50 or \\nS&P BSE SENSEX can be used.  \\n \\nFund Y: AIF Y is making thematic investments and investing in listed as well as unlisted \\nsecurities. On careful observation, it is observed that the entire 20% allocation of unlisted \\nequity shares is towards BFSI sector, while 80% allocation of listed equity shares is across \\n213 | P a g e  \\n \\nsectors. In such a scenario, the benchmark can be constructed using the actual weights, \\nsimilar to the targeted allocation. This can be done as follows: \\n \\nInvestment \\nAllocation \\nPortfolio Weight \\nRecommended Benchmark \\nBanking and \\nFinancial Services \\n20% \\nNIFTY FINANCIAL SERVICES / NIFTY BANK / \\nS&P BSE Finance / S&P BSE BANKEX \\nFast Moving \\nConsumer Goods \\n20% \\nNIFTY FMCG / S&P BSE Fast Moving \\nConsumer Goods \\nPharmaceuticals \\n20% \\nNIFTY PHARMA / S&P BSE Healthcare \\nMetals and Mining \\n10% \\nNIFTY METAL / S&P BSE Metal \\nRealty \\n10% \\nNIFTY REALTY / S&P BSE Realty \\nInformation \\nTechnology \\n20% \\nNIFTY IT / S&P BSE Information Technology \\n \\nAlternatively, the benchmark can be based on the targeted sector, i.e. Mid-cap. Following \\nindices may be used as benchmarks: \\n• NIFTY Midcap 100 \\n• NIFTY MidCap50 \\n• NIFTY Midcap 150 \\n• S&P BSE Midcap \\n• S&P BSE 150 Midcap \\n• S&P BSE 250 Midcap \\n• S&P BSE Midcap Select \\n \\nIn order to get a comprehensive performance comparison, a weighted benchmark can also \\nbe created, by considering the results from both type of benchmarks used and assigning a \\nweightage to each type of benchmark. One of the recommended ways can be as under: \\n \\nBenchmark Used \\nBenchmark Weight (recommended) \\nSectoral Benchmarks \\n75% \\nMid-cap Benchmark \\n25% \\nFund Y Benchmark \\n100% \\n \\nFund Z: AIF Z is investing in equity shares of SMEs as well as small-cap listed companies. Hence \\nthe benchmark can be constructed in the following manner: \\n \\nInvestment \\nAllocation \\nPortfolio Weight \\nRecommended Benchmark \\nSmall-cap \\nListed \\nEquity Shares \\n50% \\n• NIFTY SMALL CAP 100 \\n• NIFTY SMALL CAP 50 \\n• NIFTY SMALL CAP 250 \\n• S&P BSE Small Cap \\n• S&P 250 BSE Small Cap \\n214 | P a g e  \\n \\n• S&P BSE Small Cap Select \\n \\nListed and Unlisted \\nSMEs \\n50% \\n• NIFTY SME \\n• S&P 250 SME Index \\n \\n \\nThe above indices and benchmarks are recommended benchmarks. Every Investment \\nManager and the investors should individually decide the most appropriate benchmark, as \\nper the investment strategy of the fund. \\n \\nBenchmarking Agencies: \\n \\nAs discussed above, performance benchmarking for Category III AIFs is very subjective. The \\nInvestment Manager may use one benchmark for the purpose of reporting, while the \\ninvestors would prefer to use another benchmark. There is a need for an industry benchmark \\nfor the Category III AIF industry as a whole, to compare the performance of every Category III \\nAIF, based on the specific investment strategy followed. \\n \\nIn this regard, SEBI has mandated to develop an industry benchmark to compare the \\nperformance of AIF industry against other investment avenues including global opportunities \\nand has also recommended the formation of market-wide Benchmarking Agencies.126Any \\nassociation of AIFs which in terms of membership, represents at least 33 percent of the \\nnumber of AIFs, may notify one or more Benchmarking Agencies, who shall enter into \\nagreements with every AIF for carrying out the benchmarking process. The form and format \\nof reporting shall be mutually decided by the Association and the Benchmarking Agencies.  \\n \\nA Category III AIF, which has completed minimum 1 year from the date of First Close, shall \\nreport performance-related data, cash-flow data and scheme-wise valuation data to such \\nBenchmarking Agencies. The Category III AIF shall enter into an agreement with the relevant \\nBenchmarking Agency in order to maintain confidentiality of data, so reported.  \\n \\nThe Benchmarking Agencies shall collect the relevant data from all Category III AIFs and \\nmaintain relevant database of fund performance, based on the investment strategy followed \\nby the Funds. Such performance database will enable the comparison of funds following a \\nsimilar investment strategy, during comparable fund tenure. Category III AIFs would be \\nrequired to disclose the benchmarked performance, as derived by the Benchmarking Agency, \\nin all marketing materials and investor reports. This will enable investors to access \\nperformance data of Category III AIFs, with accurate benchmarking. \\n \\nSEBI has also laid down detailed operational guidelines for implementation of performance \\nbenchmarking (see Box 6.2). \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n126SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/IMD/DF6/CIR/P/2020/24 dated February 6, 2020 and \\nSEBI/HO/IMD/DF6/CIR/P/2020/99 dated June 12, 2020 on Disclosure Standards for Alternative Investment \\nFunds (AIFs). \\n215 | P a g e  \\n \\nBox 6.2: Operational Guidelines for Implementation of Performance Benchmarking \\n \\nSection A: \\n \\n(a) Performance Benchmarking shall be done on a half-yearly basis based on the data as on \\nSeptember 30 and March 31 of each year. \\n(b) AIFs/Schemes that have completed at least one year from First Close, shall provide all \\nthe necessary information/data to the Benchmarking Agencies. \\n(c) AIFs shall provide data on cash flows and valuation of their scheme-wise investments to \\nthe Benchmarking Agencies in the form and format required by each Benchmarking Agency, \\nwithin 45 days from the end of every half-year ending on 30th September and within 6 \\nmonths from the end of every half-year ending on 31st March. The format of data reporting \\nshall mandatorily include details of valuation principles and the name of the Valuation \\nAgency appointed by the AIF. \\n(d) Periodicity of valuation of investments shall be as provided in the SEBI (Alternative \\nInvestment Funds) Regulations. \\n(e) Data provided for March 31 of every year shall be audited data and for September30 \\nmay be unaudited data. \\n(f) Valuation of investments shall be in the manner provided in the specific Scheme’s PPM \\nor fund documents, as the case may be. Any change to valuation principle shall be informed \\nto the Benchmarking Agencies in the immediate next data submission. \\n(g) Assets under Management (AUM) for the purpose of reporting and benchmarking shall \\nbe the value of total capital drawn down under the Scheme. \\n(h) The performance reporting and benchmarking shall be carried out on pre-tax Net Asset \\nValue (NAV) of the Scheme. \\n(i) Benchmarking Agencies shall compile the data received from AIFs and create comparable \\nindustry performance benchmarks for the various categories of AIFs i.e. Category I, II and \\nIII, separately for each year since 2012. The industry performance benchmarks will be \\ndisseminated in a manner that is accessible to the public. \\n(j) Considering the diverse investment strategies and investment avenues that can be \\ndeployed by an AIF within the same category of AIF, additional performance benchmarks \\nmay be created, based on certain other parameters [besides those covered under (i) \\nabove]. Benchmarking Agency shall ensure that such performance benchmarking shall be \\nbased on objectively verifiable parameters like instrument of investment, tenure/vintage \\nof the fund, focus sectors, etc. \\n(k) Benchmarking Agencies shall provide a Performance Benchmark Report to the individual \\nAIFs/ Schemes vis-à-vis the industry benchmarks. \\n(l) Each Benchmarking Agency shall clearly provide the basis of benchmarking of individual \\nAIFs/ Schemes as well as calculation of the industry benchmark, along with the Benchmark \\nReport. \\n(m) The performance data and benchmarks shall be reported in both INR and USD terms. \\n \\nSection B: \\n \\n(n) Benchmarking Agencies may create customized Performance Reports, at the specific \\nrequest of an AIF/ Scheme, in the following manner: \\n216 | P a g e  \\n \\n(i) Identification of the set of AIFs that meet the particular criteria on which \\ncustomized performance report is to be generated. \\n(ii) Such identification may be either on the basis of self-attestation by the relevant \\nAIFs or by independent verification by Benchmarking Agencies. \\n(iii) Receipt of express consent of the AIFs whose data is needed for creating such \\nreport. \\n(iv) Preparation of customized performance reports may be a fee-based service, as \\ndecided mutually between the AIFs and the Benchmarking Agencies. \\n(v) Customized performance reports thus generated shall be called ‘Performance \\nReport’ as against the nomenclature “Benchmark Report”, which shall be used for \\nthe standard benchmark reports generated based on SEBI mandate. \\n \\nTo ensure timely and appropriate reporting of valuation of investment portfolio to \\nperformance benchmarking agencies, the following is specified:127 \\n \\n• The Investment Manager shall ensure that a specific timeframe for providing audited \\naccounts by an investee company is included as one of the terms in subscription \\nagreement / investment agreement with such investee company. This enables the \\nCategory III AIF to report valuation based on audited data of investee companies, as \\non March 31 of every financial year, to performance benchmarking agencies within \\nthe specified timeline of 6 months. \\n• The Investment Manager shall ensure that valuation, based on audited data of \\ninvestee companies, is reported to performance benchmarking agencies only after the \\naudit of books of accounts of the Category III AIF, within the stipulated timelines as \\nprovided in the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations. \\n \\nThe first performance benchmark indices for all categories of AIFs are launched on October \\n1, 2020 by CRISIL Research, a rating agency appointed by Indian Private Equity and Venture \\nCapital Association (IVCA). Subsequently, considering the rising importance of AIF as an asset \\nclass, 2 additional performance benchmark indices were launched by NSE Indices Ltd. and \\nPrequin.128 \\n6.3.1 Role of a benchmark in evaluating alpha generated by a Category III AIF  \\n \\nAlpha (α) is the excess return generated by a Category III AIF, as compared to the benchmark \\nreturn. For the purpose of comparison, the benchmark return should be computed for the \\nsame time period over which the fund return was generated. \\n \\nAlpha is computed using a common method known as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). \\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model compares the return achieved by the fund to the “Expected \\nReturn”. \\n \\nExpected Return is calculated in a unique manner, using CAPM. Ideally, the Expected Return \\n                                                          \\n \\n127  SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/AFD/PoD/CIR/2023/97 dated June 21, 2023, on Standardised approach to \\nvaluation of investment portfolio of AIFs, effective on November 1, 2023. \\n128 https://www.ivca.in/resources/performance-aifs \\n217 | P a g e  \\n \\nfrom an investment is a return above the Opportunity Cost of that investment. However, \\nunder CAPM, the Expected Return is computed with the following three elements: \\n \\n• Risk-free Rate of Return (Rf): The expected return from a risk-free security such as T-\\nbills or Government Securities. \\n \\n• Beta (β): The measure of volatility of the fund, with respect to the relevant \\nbenchmark. Beta is also known as Systematic Risk, such as changes in geo-political \\nconditions, macro-economic conditions and other market forces which are not in \\ncontrol of the Investment Manager. Such risk is not diversifiable.  \\n \\n• Market Risk Premium (Rm - Rf): The excess premium generated by the benchmark or \\nthe selected broad-based index, over the risk-free rate of return. If the premium is \\nhigh, it is beneficial for the investor to invest in such category of investments, funds \\nor broad-based indices. Rm represents the return generated by the benchmark. \\n \\nExpected Return is computed using the CAPM, as under: \\n \\nE(R) = Rf +β(Rm - Rf) \\n \\nwhere: \\nE(R) = Expected Return \\nRf = Risk-free Return \\nβ = Beta \\nRm= Benchmark Return \\n \\nFinally, Alpha is the difference between the Return achieved and Expected Return. \\n \\nAlpha (α) = R – E(R) \\n \\nThe CAPM is based on important assumptions, as follows: \\n \\n• Risk and Return: A riskier asset will yield a higher return. CAPM assumes that past \\nperformance is a good measure of future performance. \\n \\n• Risk-free Return: Risk-free return will remain constant over the course of the \\ninvestment. This may not be possible, as return on government securities may rise or \\nfall. \\n \\n• Information-efficiency: Investors have access to the same information and have the \\nsame decision-making process with respect to the risks and returns of the investment. \\n \\n218 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Taxes and Costs: There are no taxes, transaction costs or any borrowing costs with \\nrespect to investment. \\n \\n• Risk-averse Investors: CAPM assumes that the investors are risk-averse, to invest \\nrationally. For a given return the investors will prefer low-risk securities over high-risk \\nsecurities and for a given risk the investors will prefer higher returns to lower returns. \\n \\n• Decision-making: Only returns and risks are the decision making factors for investors. \\nInvestors do not consider the long term growth or qualitative factors of an investment. \\n \\n• Perfect Competition: There is perfect competition in the market and no single investor \\ncan influence the prices or the returns of the investment. \\n \\nTo understand Alpha, let us calculate Alpha for Fund XYZ with the following details: \\n \\nExample 11: \\n \\nScenarios are taken for computation of Alpha: \\n• Best-case Scenario – Above-average Net Returns for the Fund, above 12 percent p.a. \\n• Worst-case Scenario– Average Net Returns for the Fund, less than 12 percent p.a. \\n \\nParticulars \\nBest-case Scenario \\nWorst-case Scenario \\n \\n \\n \\nNet IRR \\n12.77% \\n3.38% \\nBeta \\n1.3 \\n1.5 \\n364-day T-bill rate \\n5.60 % \\nBSE 100 return (2019) \\n9.25% \\n \\nCalculate and analyse the Alpha for Fund XYZ. \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nParticulars \\nBest-case Scenario \\nWorst-case Scenario \\nExpected Return \\n[E(R) = Rf +β*(Rm - Rf)] \\n5.60% + 1.30*(9.25% - 5.60%) \\n= 10.35% \\n5.60% + 1.50*(9.25% - 5.60%) \\n= 11.08% \\nAlpha (α) = Net IRR – E(R) \\n12.77% - 10.35% \\n= 2.42% \\n3.38% - 11.08% \\n= -7.70% \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• Net IRR figures are taken instead of Gross IRR. This is on the assumption that investors \\nultimately bear fixed expenses and fees of the fund. \\n \\n219 | P a g e  \\n \\n• BSE 100 is taken as the reference benchmark, on the assumption that the fund is \\ninvesting in large-cap stocks. \\n \\n• On observation, the time period for all risk and return measures are identical. Net IRR \\nis calculated on a yearly basis. T-bill rate is for 364-day period. BSE 100 return is for \\none year – 2022.  \\n \\n• Beta has changed for Best-case scenario and Worst-case scenario, as the Investment \\nManager is taking additional systematic risk, due to macro-economic factors. Such \\nrisks are non-diversifiable, which indirectly increases Beta of the fund. \\n \\n• On comparison of the Expected Return in best-case scenario and worst-case scenario, \\nthe Expected Return has increased in the worst-case scenario, when it should \\ndecrease due to unfavourable market conditions. This is one of the limitations of the \\nCAPM Model. \\n \\n• There is a big gap between the Alpha generated by the Fund in the Best-case scenario \\nand the negative Alpha in the Worst-case scenario. This is primarily due to big \\ndifference in IRR and increased Beta in the worst-case scenario.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n220 | P a g e  \\n \\nChapter 6: Sample Questions \\n \\n1.

Category III AIFs may take leverage, short \\npositions and derivative positions, in order to generate absolute returns for investors over \\nthe medium and long term. Hence, these funds generally do not invest for the purpose of \\nintra-day trading. Speculative investments in equities may be made, if the investment \\nmanager can predict short-term profit generation for the fund. The targeted sector for \\ninvestment, basis for selection of investments, time horizon and risk-return profile of selected \\ninvestments is clearly outlined by the investment manager, in the Investment Strategy of the \\nCategory III AIF. The Investment Strategy is also disclosed to the investors, in the Private \\nPlacement Memorandum of the fund. By making capital commitments to the fund, the \\ninvestor indirectly provides consent to the investment manager on the stated investment \\nstrategy. \\n \\nEquity-Market Investment Strategy followed by Category III AIFs is a diverse and complex \\nstrategy formulated by the Investment manager, stating the nature of positions to be taken \\nin Equities or Derivatives contracts, with Equities or Equity Indices as the underlying asset. \\nThe Investment Strategy may be to invest by taking only long positions in Equities, or short \\npositions in Equities, or a combination of both types of positions. Common types of Equity-\\nMarket Investment Strategies are explained below: \\n \\n7.1.1 Long-only Equity Strategy \\n \\nThe Long-only Equity Strategy focuses on delivering absolute returns for investors over the \\nmedium to long-term, with a strong emphasis on capital preservation. In a Long-only Strategy, \\nthe Category III AIF manager would take a long position, or a ‘buy’ position in the selected \\nstocks. The manager would generally not take a short position, or a ‘sell’ position in the \\n222 | P a g e  \\n \\nselected stocks, at the time of investments in stocks. Investment managers make stock \\nselection using a top-down or bottom-up fundamental approach, with an aim to invest in \\ncompanies having predictable, scalable and quality business models. In order to invest in such \\ncompanies, the investment manager would analyse historical data of the target companies of \\ndividend pay-outs, return on capital employed and other important financial parameters. \\n \\nHowever, in order to protect the fund against losses, a prudent investment manager may take \\na “hedging position” to minimize the market risk due to decrease in value of a stock. Hedging \\npositions can be taken by taking opposite positions, i.e. a Sell position, in a Futures or Options \\ncontract of the stock or index under consideration. A sell position can be taken through a \\n“Short” position in a Futures contract or by buying a “Put” option, with the underlying asset \\nhaving similar characteristics as the reference asset in the portfolio. Despite hedging positions \\ntaken by an investment manager, a Long-only Strategy may be volatile and risky, during \\neconomic downturns. Let us understand the Long-only Strategy, using the following example. \\n \\nExample 1: Long-only Strategy \\n \\nFund FGH is a Category III AIF, with a Long-only Investment Strategy. Investments are made \\nin large-cap stocks and mid-cap stocks. Analyse the investments made by the fund. \\n \\nLong Positions: As on April 01, 2020  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nParticulars \\nQuantity \\nMarket Price (Rs.) \\nTotal Value (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStocks: Large-cap \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany A \\n1,00,000 \\n320 \\n3,20,00,000 \\nCompany B \\n10,00,000 \\n50 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany C \\n3,00,000 \\n250 \\n7,50,00,000 \\nCompany D \\n4,00,000 \\n500 \\n20,00,00,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStocks: Mid-cap \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany E \\n1,00,000 \\n500 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany F \\n1,00,000 \\n930 \\n9,30,00,000 \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\n \\nFund FGH has taken Long Positions in Large-cap and Mid-cap stocks and invested Rs. 50 crore. \\nOn account of the unexpected volatility of the stock market, it is advisable that the investment \\nmanager takes a hedging position against any future downfall. Futures and Options in a broad-\\nbased market index such as NIFTY50 or S&P BSE SENSEX can partially hedge the inherent \\nmarket risk of the Fund. Options can prove to be more efficient as compared to Futures, for \\nthe purpose of Hedging. The most suitable hedging strategy can be to Buy a Put Option on \\nthe NIFTY50 or S&P BSE SENSEX, or a combination of the indices, and keep rolling the option \\ncontracts forward. One example of a hedging position is given below: \\n \\n223 | P a g e  \\n \\nHedging Positions: \\n \\nParticulars Strike Price \\nLot-size \\n(Contracts) \\nQuantity \\n(Lots) \\nMarket \\nPrice (Rs.) \\nTotal Exposure \\n(Rs.) \\nPut Options Bought \\nNIFTY50: \\nExpiry –  \\n31 Dec 20 \\n9000.00 \\n450 \\n150 \\n 500.00 \\n3,37,50,000 \\n \\nAs seen from the table above, the Fund FGH can take Put options in NIFTY50, with an expiry \\nof December 31, 2020, which is nine months from the date of holding securities. These \\ncontracts can be rolled forward to a future expiry date, based on the years for which the same \\ninvestments will be held by the Fund FGH. The hedging positions, type of contracts and indices \\nused should be changed on a regular basis, to replicate the characteristics of the investments \\nin the fund portfolio.  \\n \\n7.1.2 Long-Short Equity Strategy  \\n \\nThe Long-Short Equity Strategy focuses on delivering absolute returns, by identifying over-\\npriced and under-priced stocks, relative to the investment manager’s fair valuation. Fair \\nvaluation of target stocks is done using fundamental analysis and taking into account macro-\\neconomic factors, industry-specific factors and government reforms. As per the investment \\nstrategy, the investment manager will have the freedom to take a long position, or ‘Buy’ \\nposition, in under-priced stocks and a short position, or ‘Sell’ position, in over-priced stocks. \\nThese funds are also characterized as ‘130/30’ funds, (or 120/20, as applicable) which means, \\nthe investment manager takes 130 percent long positions and 30 percent short positions, as \\na percentage of the total investable funds. This ensures that the net exposure to the market \\nis equal to 100 percent of the value of total investable funds. The short positions are usually \\nundertaken by investing through the options and futures contracts on the underlying assets.  \\n \\nIn contrast with a Long-only Strategy, the investment manager can take a short position in \\nstocks, even at the time of investments in stocks. This provides greater flexibility to the \\ninvestment manager and can create a natural hedge against total market risk of the Category \\nIII AIF. This is possible if both short positions and long positions are taken in stocks, which \\nhave the same characteristics or in the same industry. Long-short Strategy can be volatile and \\nrisky, during economic downturns. Excessive leverage and short positions taken by the \\ninvestment manager can also increase the volatility of the fund. Hence, SEBI restricts the \\nleverage taken by Long-Short Funds, such that total exposure in long positions and short \\npositions, net off any offsetting positions, is not more than 2 times the Assets under \\nManagement of the fund. \\n \\nLet us understand the Long-short Strategy, using the following example. \\n \\n \\n224 | P a g e  \\n \\nExample 2: Long-short Strategy \\n \\nFund TCR is a Category III AIF, with a Long-short Investment Strategy. Investments are made \\nin large-cap and mid-cap stocks, as well as derivative contracts. Analyse the investments made \\nby the fund. \\n \\nPositions in Stocks and Derivatives: As on April 01, 2020  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nParticulars \\nExposure \\nQuantity \\nMarket Price (Rs.) \\nTotal Value (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStocks: Large-cap \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany B \\nBuy \\n10,00,000 \\n50 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany C \\nSell \\n3,00,000 \\n250 \\n7,50,00,000 \\nCompany D \\nBuy \\n4,00,000 \\n500 \\n20,00,00,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStocks: Mid-cap \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany E \\nBuy \\n1,00,000 \\n500 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany F \\nSell \\n1,00,000 \\n930 \\n9,30,00,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nParticulars Strike \\nPrice \\nLot-size \\n(Contracts) \\nQuantity \\n(Lots) \\nMarket \\nPrice (Rs.) \\nTotal  \\nExposure (Rs.) \\nPut Options Bought \\nNIFTY50: \\nExpiry –  \\n31 Dec 20 \\n9000.00 \\n450 \\n50 \\n 500.00 \\n1,12,50,000 \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\n \\nAs seen from the tables above, Fund TCR has taken Buy and Sell positions in Large-cap stocks \\nand also hedged the risk, by taking adequate Put options in NIFTY50, with an expiry of \\nDecember 31, 2020, which is nine months from the date of holding securities. However, the \\nFund has an additional exposure to Mid-cap stocks. The investment manager has taken a buy \\nposition in one stock and a sell position in one stock in the Mid-cap sector. However, such \\nexposures are not perfectly offsetting the market risk and total exposure to the Mid-cap \\nsector. Such exposure in the Mid-cap sector can significantly increase the total risk and \\nvolatility of the fund. \\n \\n7.1.3 Market-Neutral Strategy \\n \\nThe Market-Neutral Strategy, like the Long-Short Strategy focuses on delivering absolute \\nreturns, by identifying over-priced and under-priced stocks, relative to the investment \\nmanager’s fair valuation. The difference in Market-Neutral Strategy is that the Category III AIF \\nhas net ‘zero’ or ‘neutral’ exposure to a particular sector, industry or market-capitalization of \\n225 | P a g e  \\n \\ncompanies in the equity market. As per the investment strategy, Category III AIF managers \\ntake equal amount of long and short exposures in Equities, through long positions, in under-\\npriced stocks, and short positions, in over-priced stocks. As the Category III AIF is neutral to \\nthe broad-based market index, industry or sector, the ‘Beta’ or systematic risk of the fund is \\nzero, or close to zero. Investment Managers may use either fundamental analysis or \\nquantitative algorithms, to estimate growth of a company’s stock, and take long or short \\npositions, accordingly. \\n \\nIn contrast with Long-short Strategy, the investment manager of a Market Neutral Strategy \\nwill have to ensure that the Portfolio Beta is not significantly higher or lower than “Zero”. A \\nhigh Beta signifies greater volatility of the fund. Hence, the investment manager has low \\nflexibility to trade freely in various stocks, by market-capitalization, industry or sector. \\nMarket-Neutral funds use long and short positions with the aim of minimizing the systematic \\nrisk of the portfolio, whereas, long-short funds use long and short positions with the aim of \\ntaking advantage of undervalued and overvalued opportunities. \\n \\nA zero Beta does not ensure that the Strategy is not volatile or risky, during economic \\ndownturns. Excessive leverage and concentrated positions taken in stocks can also increase \\nthe volatility of the fund. Let us understand the Market-Neutral Strategy, using the following \\nexample. \\n \\nExample 3: Market-Neutral Strategy \\n \\nFund PQC is a Category III AIF, with a Market-Neutral Investment Strategy. Investments are \\nmade in large-cap and mid-cap stocks, using derivative contracts or direct equity exposure. \\nAnalyse the investments made by the fund. \\n \\nPositions in Stocks and Derivatives: As on April 01, 2020  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nParticulars \\nExposure \\nQuantity \\nStock Beta \\nMarket \\nPrice (Rs.) \\nTotal  \\nValue (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLarge-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany B \\nBuy \\n10,00,000 \\n0.40 \\n50 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany C \\nBuy \\n2,00,000 \\n2.00 \\n250 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany D \\nSell \\n2,00,000 \\n1.20 \\n500 \\n(10,00,00,000) \\nNet Exposure \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n0.00 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMid-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany E \\nBuy \\n1,00,000 \\n1.50 \\n500 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany F \\nSell \\n1,00,000 \\n1.50 \\n500 \\n(5,00,00,000) \\nNet Exposure \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n0.00 \\n \\n \\n \\n226 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars Strike Price Lot-size \\n(Contracts) \\nQuantity \\n(Lots) \\nMarket \\nPrice \\n(Rs.) \\nIndex Options: Bought \\nNIFTY50: \\nCall \\nExpiry –  \\n31 Dec 20 \\n10000.00 \\n750 \\n30 \\n750.00 \\nNIFTY50: \\nPut \\nExpiry –  \\n31 Dec 20 \\n9500.00 \\n450 \\n50 \\n 500.00 \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\n \\nAs seen from the tables above, the Fund PQC has taken Buy and Sell positions in Large-cap \\nstocks as well Mid-cap stocks. The long and short exposures in both segments is neutral, as \\nthe total amount invested in Long positions in Large-cap stocks is equal to the total amount \\ninvested in Short positions in Large-cap stocks. Similarly, the total amount invested in Long \\npositions in Mid-cap stocks is equal to the total amount invested in Short positions in Mid-cap \\nstocks. \\n \\nThe portfolio beta is zero, as the total exposure to the broad-based market is neutral. The \\nportfolio beta is computed as the total of weighted average of the stock-specific Beta, within \\neach class of investments, computed as follows: \\n \\n \\nParticulars \\nStock Beta \\n[A] \\nValue of  \\nInvestment \\nWeights* \\n[B] \\nWeighted \\nAverage \\nBeta [A*B] \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLarge-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany B \\n0.40 \\n5,00,00,000 \\n0.25 \\n0.10 \\nCompany C \\n2.00 \\n5,00,00,000 \\n0.25 \\n0.50 \\nCompany D \\n1.20 (10,00,00,000) \\n0.50 \\n(0.60) \\nTotal \\n \\nNIL \\n \\n0.00 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMid-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany E \\n1.50 \\n5,00,00,000 \\n0.50 \\n0.75 \\nCompany F \\n1.50 \\n(5,00,00,000) \\n0.50 \\n(0.75) \\nTotal \\n \\nNIL \\n \\n0.00 \\n* Weights are computed by dividing the investment in the company, by the total \\ninvestments in the sector-specific stocks, viz. large-cap stocks and mid-cap stocks \\n \\nHowever, the exposures in individual stocks bear risk, unrelated to the market risk. This is also \\nknown as Unsystematic Risk. The individual price movements of each stock can significantly \\n227 | P a g e  \\n \\nchange the portfolio mix, as the investment manager will again need to bring the Portfolio \\nBeta to Zero. \\n \\nOn analysing the positions in NIFTY50 options, it is observed that the fund has taken a Call \\nOption on NIFTY50, with a Strike Price of 10,000 and a Put Option on NIFTY50, with a Strike \\nPrice of 9500. Expiry Dates for the Call option and Put option are same, i.e. December 31, \\n2020. Total exposure taken in terms of number of contracts is the same in Call Options and \\nPut Options, i.e. 22,500 contracts. The Fund has neutralized the exposure to NIFTY50, for any \\nvalue above 10,000 or any value below 9,500. However, the fund will be exposed to market \\nrisk, if the NIFTY50 value as on December 31, 2020 is between 9500 and 10000. Due to \\ndifferent strike prices of the NIFTY50 options, the portfolio beta is not zero. Hence, the \\npositions taken in the derivatives contracts are NOT Market-Neutral, as observed in positions \\ntaken in Large-cap stocks and Mid-cap stocks. The Portfolio Beta, after taking into \\nconsideration all positions in equity markets and derivative markets, will be close to zero. \\n \\nPractically, the portfolio beta will not remain exactly zero, for a Category III AIF following the \\nMarket-Neutral Strategy. For instance, in our example the portfolio beta was changed due to \\nthe Index Options taken on NIFTY50. If these options are taken for the purpose of hedging \\nmarket risk, then a change in Portfolio Beta is justified. Hence, Portfolio Beta of close to zero \\nis also justified, if a Category III AIF is pursuing a Market-Neutral Strategy. \\n \\n7.1.4 Directional and Short-bias Strategies \\n \\nA Directional Strategy focuses on delivering absolute returns for investors by taking either a \\nnet long position or a net short position in the selected stocks or a broad-based market index. \\nThe Category III AIF manager takes an investment call on the direction of the overall market, \\nover the short-term or medium to long-term. If the investment manager has taken net long \\npositions, the fund will benefit from an upward movement in the market, and vice-versa. A \\nDirectional Strategy is an opposite of Market-Neutral Strategy, as the investment manager \\nwill not aim at having a Portfolio Beta of zero or close to zero. \\n \\nA Dedicated-Short Directional Strategy is a category of Directional Strategy, in which the \\ninvestment manager exclusively takes short positions only. Similarly, a Dedicated-Long \\nDirectional Strategy is a category of Directional Strategy, in which the investment manager \\nexclusively takes long positions only.  \\n \\nShort-bias Strategy is a type of Directional Strategy, wherein the investment manager takes \\nboth long and short positions in selected stocks or a broad-based market index, but maintains \\na net short exposure to the broad market. A Short-bias Strategy will also benefit from \\ndownward movement in the market. \\n \\nShort-bias Strategy differs from a Long-only Strategy, as the fund maintains a net long \\nexposure in a Long-only Strategy and net short exposure in a Short-bias Strategy. Similarly, in \\na Long-short Strategy, the investment manager may maintain a net long or a net short \\nexposure, as compared to the net short exposure to be maintained in a Short-bias Strategy. \\n228 | P a g e  \\n \\nIn a typical ‘130/30’ long-short strategy, the investment manager maintains a net long \\nposition, up to 100 percent of the total investable funds.  \\n \\nThe Dedicated-Long Strategy also differs from the long-short strategy. The investment \\nmanager may take both long and short positions in the long-short strategy, as compared to \\nexclusively taking long positions in a Dedicated-Long Strategy. A Directional Strategy and a \\nShort-bias Strategy may be volatile and risky, during major macro-economic upturns as well \\nas downturns, depending on the net exposure taken by the investment manager. Let us \\nunderstand the Directional Strategy and Short-bias Strategy, using the following example. \\n \\nExample 4: Directional Strategy and Short-bias Strategy \\n \\nFund LMN and Fund TGR are Category III AIFs. Investments are made in large-cap stocks, mid-\\ncap stocks, using derivative contracts or direct equity exposure. Identify the Investment \\nStrategy pursued by both funds and analyse the investments made by the funds. \\n \\nFund LMN: \\n \\nPositions in Stocks: As on April 01, 2020 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nParticulars \\nExposure \\nQuantity \\nMarket Price (Rs.) \\nTotal Value (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLarge-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany C \\nBuy \\n2,00,000 \\n250 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany D \\nSell \\n2,00,000 \\n500 \\n(10,00,00,000) \\nNet Exposure: \\n \\n \\n \\n(5,00,00,000) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMid-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany E \\nBuy \\n1,00,000 \\n500 \\n5,00,00,000 \\nCompany F \\nSell \\n1,50,000 \\n500 \\n(7,50,00,000) \\nNet Exposure: \\n \\n \\n \\n(2,50,00,000) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFund TGR: \\n \\nPositions in Stocks: As on April 01, 2020 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nParticulars \\nExposure \\nQuantity \\nMarket Price (Rs.) \\nTotal Value (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLarge-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany H \\nBuy \\n5,00,000 \\n700 \\n35,00,00,000 \\nCompany I \\nBuy \\n2,00,000 \\n1500 \\n30,00,00,000 \\nNet Exposure: \\n \\n \\n \\n65,00,00,000 \\n \\n229 | P a g e  \\n \\nEquity Derivatives Exposures: As on April 01, 2020  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nParticulars Strike Price Lot-size \\n(Contracts) \\nQuantity \\n(Lots) \\nMarket \\nPrice \\n(Rs.) \\nIndex Options: Bought \\nNIFTY50: \\nCall \\nExpiry –  \\n31 Dec 20 \\n10000.00 \\n750 \\n30 \\n750.00 \\nNIFTY50: \\nCall \\nExpiry –  \\n31 Dec 20 \\n9500.00 \\n750 \\n50 \\n805.00 \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\n \\nAs seen from the tables above: \\n \\n• Fund LMN is pursuing a Short-bias Strategy. The fund has net short positions in Large-\\ncap stocks as well as Mid-cap stocks. \\n \\n• Fund TGR is pursuing a Directional Strategy, particularly a Dedicated-Long Directional \\nStrategy. The fund has bought shares of large-cap stocks as well as taken Call Options \\non the broad market index – NIFTY50, for a later expiry date, which indicates that the \\nfund will profit if the NIFTY50 value increases.  \\n \\n7.2 Global-Macro Strategy \\n \\nUnlike Equity Market Strategies discussed above, Category III AIFs pursuing a Global Macro \\nInvestment Strategy can take both long and short positions across asset classes such as \\ncurrencies, fixed income securities, equities, commodities, real assets and interest rate \\nderivatives. The objective of the fund will be to earn positive absolute returns for the \\ninvestors, by investing in multiple markets and geographies. Global-Macro Strategies helps a \\nfund to diversify across multiple asset classes and manage total risk of the fund portfolio. \\n \\nThe investment manager makes stock selection primarily on the basis of macro-economic \\ntrends and factors, instead of fundamental analysis of historical data of every company. Major \\nplayers in the Category III AIF market have advanced Algorithms to analyse macro-economic \\ntrends on multiple dimensions, utilizing both quantitative and discretionary inputs. \\n \\nThe fund may apply a long-only strategy, market-neutral strategy, directional strategy or a \\nlong-short strategy to invest across multiple markets, asset classes and geographies. For \\nexample, a global macro investment manager may decide to take long positions in Indian \\n230 | P a g e  \\n \\ncorporate debt securities, short positions in Euro, long positions in U.S. T-bills and stay \\nmarket-neutral when investing in Crude, subject to regulatory guidelines published from time \\nto time. Let us understand the Global Macro Strategy, using the following example. \\n \\nExample 5: Global-macro Strategy \\n \\nFund GMS is a Category III AIF, with the following holdings, as on April 30, 2020. Identify the \\nInvestment Strategy pursued by the fund and analyse the investments made by the fund. \\n \\nParticulars \\nExposure Quantity \\nMarket Price (Rs.) \\nTotal Value (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLarge-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany J \\nBuy \\n2,00,000 \\n1,000 \\n20,00,00,000 \\nCompany K \\nBuy \\n1,00,000 \\n2,250 \\n22,50,00,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMid-cap Stocks \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany E \\nBuy \\n10,000 \\n500 \\n50,00,000 \\nCompany F \\nBuy \\n10,000 \\n500 \\n50,00,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOther Exposures: Currency \\n \\nParticulars Lot-size \\n(Contracts) \\nQuantity \\n(Lots) \\nFutures Price  \\nCurrency Futures: Short Positions \\nUSDINR \\n20MAYFUT \\n1000 \\n150 \\n75.20 \\nGBPINR \\n20MAYFUT \\n1000 \\n150 \\n94.10 \\n \\nOther Exposures: Crude Oil \\n \\nParticulars Lot-size \\n(Barrels) \\nQuantity \\n(Lots) \\nFutures Price  \\nCommodity Futures: Long Positions for Settlement \\nCrude Oil \\nWTI  \\n1000 \\n10,000 \\n1333 \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\nAs seen from the tables above: \\n• Fund GMS is pursuing a Global-macro Strategy, as it has invested across multiple asset \\nclasses, being Indian Stocks, currency derivatives and crude oil futures. Long positions \\nare taken in equities and oil contracts, while short positions are taken in currency \\n231 | P a g e  \\n \\nderivatives. Since the fund has a net long exposure, it can be concluded that the \\nInvestment Strategy is a Long-Short strategy. \\n \\n• Exposure in multiple markets and multiple asset classes are also taken by the fund. A \\nlong position in the WTI Oil Futures contract signifies that the investment manager is \\nbullish on oil and equity asset class. \\n \\n7.3 Convertible Arbitrage Strategy \\n \\nConvertible Arbitrage Strategy is a type of long-short strategy used by a Category III AIF, to \\nbenefit from the mispricing of a Convertible Debt or Convertible Preference share of a \\ncompany, which are called as Convertible Securities or Hybrid Securities. A convertible \\nsecurity is a hybrid debt or preference share issued by a company, which gives an option to \\nits holder to convert the security into equity shares at a pre-determined date and a conversion \\nratio based on the pre-determined price of the equity share. If an investor purchases such \\nconvertible securities, such investor can continue to hold the convertible security and receive \\ncoupons, or choose to convert the security to equity shares, on the Exercise Date and at \\nExercise Price of the option. \\n \\nA Category III AIF pursuing the Convertible Arbitrage strategy will take a long position in \\nconvertible securities issued by a company and simultaneously take a short position in the \\nsame company’s equity shares. This Strategy is pursued to earn a riskless profit, independent \\nof stock price movements, known as Convertible Arbitrage. If the equity share price falls, the \\nfund will benefit from its short position and continue to earn fixed income, in the form of \\ncoupons on the convertible security. On the other hand, if the equity share price rises, the \\nfund can choose to convert its convertible security into equity shares and sell the equity \\nshares at market value, which can compensate for any losses on the short position taken in \\nequity shares. \\n \\nThe idea behind convertible arbitrage is that a company’s convertible bonds are sometimes \\npriced inefficiently relative to the company’s equity shares. The pricing is determined by the \\nConversion Ratio, inherent in the convertible security. A Category III AIF can attempt to profit \\nfrom pricing errors in the convertible securities. Convertible Arbitrage is difficult to implement \\nand can be riskier, especially at times of changing macro-economic factors and unpredictable \\nevents. The market factors, economic cycles and company fundamentals play an important \\nrole for the Convertible Arbitrage to be implemented successfully. Let us understand the \\nConvertible Arbitrage Strategy, using the following example. \\n \\nExample 6: Convertible Arbitrage Strategy \\n \\nFund CAS is a Category III AIF, which is pursuing a Convertible Arbitrage Strategy while \\ninvesting in Corporate Bonds of Company A. Analyse the profits earned by the fund. \\n \\n \\n232 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount \\nData as on April 01, 2020: \\nLong: 12% Convertible Bond – Face Value of Rs. 1,000 \\nRs. 1,00,00,000 \\nConversion Ratio (after 1-year lock-in of investment) \\n25:1 \\nCapital Invested \\nRs. 20,00,000 \\nBorrowed Capital @ 10% p.a. \\nRs. 80,00,000 \\nShort positions in equity shares of Company A \\n50,000 equity shares \\nFace Value of Equity share of Company A \\nRs. 5/share \\nEquity Share Price – as on April 01, 2020 \\nRs. 40 \\nBorrowing Fee – For Short Positions in Equity Shares \\nRs. 5/share \\n \\nData as on March 31, 2021: \\nDividend declared on Equity shares \\nRs. 2/share \\nConvertible Bond Price  \\nRs. 1,050 \\nEquity Share Price  \\nRs. 42.50 \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\nFund CAS has taken long positions in Convertible Bonds and short positions in equity shares \\nof Company A. \\n \\nThe total investment in Bonds was Rs. 1,00,00,000. The investment was financed by 20% fund \\ncapital and 80% borrowed capital. Conversion Ratio is 25:1, which indicates 25 equity shares \\nwill be issued for every bond of Rs. 1,000 face value, on the exercise date. Based on the \\nMarket Price of Equity Shares, as on April 01, 2020, the value of 25 equity shares is Rs. 1,000, \\nwhich equates the Face Value of Rs. 1,000 of the Convertible Bond. This indicates that the \\nConversion Ratio is fairly priced.  \\n \\nOn implementation of the Convertible Arbitrage Strategy, the following incomes/loss and \\nexpenses shall accrue for Fund CAS, during the period April 01, 2020 to March 31, 2021: \\n \\nParticulars \\nCalculation \\nAmount (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\nIncome/(Expenses): \\n \\n \\nBorrowing Cost –  \\nOn Borrowed Capital  \\nRs. 80,00,000 @ 10% pa \\n(Interest for 1 year) \\n(8,00,000) \\nCoupon Interest on the Bond \\nRs. 1,00,00,000 @ 12% \\n12,00,000 \\nBorrowing Fees –  \\nOn Short Equity Positions \\n50,000 shares @ Rs. 5/share \\n(Fees for 50,000 equity shares) \\n(2,50,000) \\nDividend Foregone –  \\nOn Short Equity Positions \\n50,000 shares @ Rs. 2/share \\n(Fees for 50,000 equity shares) \\n(1,00,000) \\n \\n \\n \\nExit Value of Long/(Short) \\npositions: \\n \\n \\n233 | P a g e  \\n \\nProfit on Conversion of Bonds \\n2,50,000 shares @ Rs. 42.50/share \\nLess: Investment Rs. 1,00,00,000 \\n6,25,000 \\nLoss of Squaring-off Short Positions \\nin Equity  \\n50,000 shares @ Rs. 2.50/share \\n(Difference of Rs. 42.50 - Rs. 40.00) \\n(1,25,000) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTotal Income / (Loss) \\n5,50,000 \\n \\nTotal Fund Investment \\n20,00,000 \\n \\nReturn on Investment (ROI) \\n27.50 % \\n \\nFrom the above table, it is important to note that: \\n \\n• The Fund CAS has been successfully able to implement the Convertible Arbitrage \\nStrategy, by anticipating the change in expected equity price of the Company. The \\nConversion Ratio was fairly valued at the beginning of the year, but was mispriced by \\nthe end of the year due to increase in the price of the equity shares. \\n \\n• If the price of equity shares would have decreased, the Fund would not choose to \\nconvert the bonds into equity and square-off the short position in equity shares, with \\na net gain of 15%. \\n \\n• Borrowing Fees is the Fees incurred by the Fund, in order to borrow the securities for \\nthe purpose of short positions or short sale. This is an additional cost to the Fund. \\nSimilarly, dividends declared by the company will not accrue to the investor, as the \\ninvestor has a short position in the equity shares. Borrowing Cost of 10% will be \\nincurred to the extent of leverage taken by the fund, when investing in the Convertible \\nBonds. However, the coupon interest on the bond will be an additional risk-free \\nincome for the fund. \\n \\n7.4 Event-driven Investment Strategies \\n \\nEvent-driven Investment Strategy followed by Category III AIFs involves taking positions in \\nEquities or Derivatives contracts of one target company, pursuant to a significant corporate \\nevent at the Company, such as Debt re-structuring, Mergers, Acquisitions, Spin-offs or change \\nin management of the company. Such significant changes in the Company impact the market \\nprice of the Equity shares or Fixed Income securities of the company under consideration. \\nEvent-driven Investment Strategy may involve taking both long positions and short positions \\nin Equities or Fixed Income Securities, unlike Equity-Market Strategy. The primary indicator \\nfor implementing the Event-driven Strategy is a material corporate event. Common types of \\nEvent-driven Investment Strategies are explained below: \\n \\n7.4.1 Activist Strategy  \\n \\nAn Activist Strategy is implemented by a Category III AIF, to make a significant investment in \\nan investee company and benefit from a material corporate event in that investee company. \\n234 | P a g e  \\n \\nMaterial corporate events such as change in management teams, filing for bankruptcy or \\nshutting down one business segment, may lead to a significant decrease in equity prices of \\nthe company. If a Category III AIF manager estimates that the fund can earn profits, by \\nchanging the operational efficiency of an investee company, significant funds are invested in \\nthat investee company which can enable the fund to participate in the management process \\nof the investee company. Such Category III AIFs are also known as Activist Funds, who take a \\nprivate equity approach and a long-term oriented approach to make investments. \\n \\nUnder the stewardship code released by SEBI, all Alternative Investment Funds are required \\nto actively monitor their investee companies and vote in important company matters. All \\nAlternative Investment Funds should also have a clear policy for collaboration with other \\ninstitutional investors, in order to preserve the interests of the ultimate investors. \\n \\nActivist Funds differ from traditional funds by having a less diversified portfolio and illiquid \\ninvestments. In India, SEBI has placed concentration limits on Category III AIFs, to invest not \\nmore than 10 percent of its Investable Funds or its NAV, in one single investee company. \\nActivist Strategy is yet in the nascent stages of investments. As the investments involve a big \\ncapital commitment, Large Value Funds are most suitable for implementing this strategy. SEBI \\nhas relaxed the concentration limits for Large Value Funds, which can invest not more than \\n20 percent of its Investable Funds or its NAV, in one single investee company. Given the \\nconcentration limits, Indian Category III AIFs are typically able to invest in small-cap or mid-\\ncap companies which have a high failure risk, especially when the investment manager is \\nlooking to take a substantial stake and turnaround the company. \\n7.4.2 Merger Arbitrage Strategy \\n \\nMerger Arbitrage Strategy is a type of an Event-driven strategy used by a Category III AIF, to \\nbenefit from the Merger or Acquisition of one ‘Target’ Company by an ‘Acquiring’ Company.  \\nIn a Merger or Acquisition process, the company buying the shares of another company is \\nknown as the Acquiring Company. Likewise, the company selling its shares or being merged \\ninto an Acquiring Company is known as the Target Company. \\n \\nA Category III AIF pursuing the Merger Arbitrage strategy will take a long position in equity \\nshares issued by the Target Company and simultaneously take a short or long position in the \\nequity shares issued by the Acquiring Company. This Strategy is pursued to earn an arbitrage \\nprofit from stock movements in the Target Company and Acquiring Company. \\n \\nWhen an Acquiring Company provides its best offer in the merger or acquisition deal to the \\nTarget Company, it typically needs to pay a premium over the Target Company’s unaffected \\nequity share price, or the current share price before the deal. This premium is necessary \\nbecause such Target Company’s board of directors is only likely to approve the acquisition of \\nthe company, if the Acquisition Price is significantly higher than the current equity share price \\nof the company. Hence, a long position is taken in the equity shares of the Target Company, \\nto capitalize on the spread between the Target Company’s current share price and the \\nAcquisition Price, on completion of the deal. \\n \\n235 | P a g e  \\n \\nSimilarly, a short position is taken in the equity shares of the Acquiring Company primarily on \\naccount of two reasons: \\n• Uncertainty in deal-completion: Till the final allotment of shares by the Acquiring \\nCompany, there is a risk that the deal may not be approved by the Target Company \\nor the concerned regulatory authorities. From the date of announcement of the \\nmerger or acquisition deal, the process of taking board approvals, regulatory \\napprovals and shareholder approvals, are initiated. If at any stage, the deal is not \\napproved or is delayed, there is a high risk that the deal can fail.  \\n \\n• Premium to Target Company: If the premium to be paid to the Target Company is \\nover-valued, there is an inherent risk that the equity share price of the Acquiring \\nCompany will fall. Conversely, if the Premium paid is under-valued, there is a high \\nprobability of the equity share price rising, for the Acquiring Company. The valuation \\nmethod adopted to compute the Fair Market Value of one share of the Target \\nCompany, would impact the conversion ratio and hence, could lead to arbitrage \\n \\nMerger Arbitrage Strategy can be successfully implemented by a Category III AIF, if the \\ninvestment manager can estimate the fair value of the premium to be paid by the Acquiring \\nCompany, which decides the Conversion Ratio to be offered, and accordingly take long or \\nshort positions in the equity shares of the Acquiring Company. Like any other strategy, Merger \\nArbitrage Strategy can be risky on account of changing macro-economic factors and \\nunpredictable events in the company. Market factors, economic cycles and company \\nfundamentals play an important role for the Merger Arbitrage to be implemented \\nsuccessfully. Let us understand the Merger Arbitrage Strategy, using the following example. \\n \\nExample 7: Merger Arbitrage Strategy \\n \\nFund MAS is a Category III AIF, which is pursuing a Merger Arbitrage Strategy while investing \\nin Equity Shares of Company ID and Company CF. Merger of Company CF in Company ID is \\nannounced on January 15, 2018. Both Company Boards have approved the merger. \\n \\nAnalyse the stock positions taken by the fund. \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount \\n \\n \\nData as on January 15, 2018:11:00:00 AM \\nAcquiring Company ID – Equity Share Price \\nRs. 540.00 \\nTarget Company CF – Equity Share Price \\nRs. 39.25 \\n \\n \\nAnnouncement of Merger Deal on January 15, 2018 at 11:01:00 AM  \\nCompany ID to acquire Company CF, in a full-stock deal \\n \\nConversion Ratio \\n139 : 10 \\n \\n \\nData as on January 15, 2018: 03:30 PM (Closing Prices) \\nAcquiring Company ID – Equity Share Price \\nRs. 567.80 \\n236 | P a g e  \\n \\nTarget Company CF – Equity Share Price \\nRs. 41.00 \\n \\n \\nPositions taken by Fund MAS on January 15, 2018 at 11:02:00 AM  \\nBuy 1 lakh equity shares of Company CF @ Rs. 540/share \\nRs. 5.400 crore \\nBuy 10 lakh equity shares of Company ID @ Rs. 39.25/share Rs. 3.925 crore \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\nMerger of Company CF, into Company ID has already been approved by both the Boards and \\nthe regulators, as stated above. Hence, the risk of the deal failure is minimal. In such a case, \\nthe Fund should ideally take long positions in equity shares of the Acquiring Company also. \\n \\nWithin a minute of the announcement of the deal, Fund MAS has taken BUY positions in \\nequity shares of Company CF, i.e. the Target Company, and equity shares of Company ID, i.e. \\nthe Acquiring Company. Profit earned by the Fund is as follows: \\n \\nParticulars \\nInvestment \\n(Rs.) \\nNo. of Shares \\nClosing Price \\n(Rs.) \\nTotal Value \\n(Rs.) \\nEquity Shares: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany CF \\n5,40,00,000 \\n1,00,000 \\n567.80 \\n5,67,80,000 \\nCompany ID \\n3,92,50,000 \\n10,00,000 \\n41.00 \\n4,10,00,000 \\n \\n \\nTotal Value \\n9,77,80,000 \\n \\n \\nTotal Investments \\n9,32,50,000 \\n \\n \\nReturn on Investment (%) \\n4.86% \\n \\nAs seen from the table above, Fund MAS has generated a 4.86% within one day, by \\nsuccessfully implementing the Merger Arbitrage Strategy: \\n \\nThe Investment manager was successful in analysing the market and making the right \\ninvestment call to take a long position in the equity shares of Company ID. This can be done \\nby valuing the security, based on the Conversion Ratio agreed in the Merger. Conversion Ratio \\nwas 139:10 i.e. shareholders of Company CF will be issued 139 shares of Company ID, for \\nevery 10 shares in the company. \\n \\nBased on the calculations using equity share prices as on January 15, 2018: 11:00:00 AM, we \\ncan calculate the fair value of the Acquiring Company, as follows: \\n \\nFair Price of Company ID = \\n139∗39.25 \\n10\\n= Rs. 545.58 \\n \\nMarket Price of Company ID = Rs. 540.00 \\n \\nSince the equity shares of Company ID are under-valued, based on the Conversion Ratio \\noffered in the Merger Transaction, the investment manager should BUY the equity shares of \\nCompany ID. Hence, the stock positions taken by the investment manager is justified. \\n237 | P a g e  \\n \\n7.4.3 Pre-IPO Strategy \\n \\nAn Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to the time when a company goes public for the first \\ntime and offers its shares to investors in the primary stock market. It is the initial sale of stock \\nthat a company issues to the public. Pre-IPO shares are the specific shares, with unique \\nidentification numbers, issued to the employees or institutional investors in the company, \\nincluding Category III AIFs, before such shares are offered to the general public, in an IPO. Pre-\\nIPO shares are offered to institutional investors at a discount to the issue price of equity \\nsecurities in the IPO, due to sufficiently large amount of investments made and risk taken by \\nsuch institutional investors. Pre-IPO Placement is the process of allotment of Pre-IPO shares \\nto certain institutional investors, just before the date of the IPO of the investee company. \\n \\nA Category III AIF pursuing a Pre-IPO Strategy is a fund which has the mandate to subscribe to \\nPre-IPO shares of an investee company, at a discount from the issue price of the equity \\nsecurities in the IPO. As per the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) \\nRegulations, 2018 institutional investors including Category III AIFs, subscribing to Pre-IPO \\nshares or a Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP), are subject to a minimum lock-in period of \\n6 months, from the date of listing of such shares through an IPO, by the investee company. In \\ncase of fresh issue of equity shares, if the majority of the proceeds from such fresh issue are \\nproposed to be utilised for capital expenditure, then the lock-in period for such shares shall \\nbe 1 year.129 \\n \\nLet us understand Pre-IPO Strategy with the following example: \\n \\nExample 8: Pre-IPO Strategy \\n \\nFund PPI is a Category III AIF pursuing a Pre-IPO Strategy while investing in Equity Shares of a \\nprivately-held Company ABC. Fund PPI had invested in the Company through a Private \\nPlacement, on January 15, 2020 and bought 2,50,000 shares of the Company from the \\npromoter, at Rs. 120/share. \\n \\nCompany ABC announced an IPO of 10,00,000 shares with an Issue Price of Rs. 130 per share, \\nwhich was completed on June 15, 2020 and shares were allotted to the respective allottees. \\nThe following table shows the shareholding pattern of Company ABC, post the IPO.  \\n \\nParticulars \\nNo. of Shares Held Offer \\nPrice \\n(Rs.) \\n% of Holding \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nInstitutional Investors \\n \\n \\n \\nFund PPI \\n2,50,000 \\n120 \\n16.67% \\nMutual Funds \\n1,50,000 \\n130 \\n10.00% \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNon-Institutional Investors \\n2,00,000 \\n130 \\n13.33% \\n                                                          \\n \\n129As per Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) (Third \\nAmendment) Regulations, 2021 \\n238 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRetail Individual Investors \\n3,50,000 \\n130 \\n23.33% \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPromoter Holding \\n5,50,000 \\nNA \\n36.67% \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTotal Holding \\n15,00,000 \\n \\n100% \\n \\nAnalyse the investment made by Fund PPI. \\n \\nAnalysis: \\n \\nFund PPI follows a Pre-IPO Strategy. It has subscribed to shares of a privately-held company, \\nat a significant discount to the Issue Price for the IPO of Company ABC. The discount received \\nis Rs. 10 per share or 7.70% off the Issue Price, for taking a 16.67% stake in the Company. The \\nshares held by the Fund will be locked-in for a period of 6 months, from the date of listing of \\nshares pursuant to the IPO, i.e. June 15, 2020.  \\n \\nOn observation of the total post-IPO shareholding for Company ABC, it can be observed that \\nthe Total number of outstanding shares are 15,00,000, out of which 5,50,000 shares are \\nretained by the promoters of the company,7,00,000 shares are issued through the IPO \\nprocess and 2,50,000 shares were issued as Pre-IPO shares to Fund PPI. \\n \\n7.5 Due Diligence Process \\n \\nCategory III AIFs seek capital commitments from sophisticated investors and institutional \\ninvestors. These investors may be High Net worth Individuals or Institutions such as \\nEndowments, Foundations, Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Banks, Financial \\nInstitutions, Insurance Companies and other corporate entities. Corporate Institutions have a \\npre-defined methodology for screening a potential investment. Such institutions seek for ‘Red \\nFlags’ or any internal and external factors that may materially impact the stated risk-return \\nobjective of the investment. This process is known as “Due Diligence” and the investors \\nconduct due diligence in the following manner, before investing in a potential Category III AIF. \\nInvestment Due Diligence \\nInvestment Due Diligence is done to analyse the financial performance and factors influencing \\nthe financial performance of a Category III AIF, in order to verify the expected return and risk \\nfactors stated by the fund in its Private Placement Memorandum. Macro-economic factors as \\nwell as business-related factors of the Category III AIF are crucial, to conduct the Investment \\nDue Diligence. \\nSome of the points taken into consideration for conducting the Investment Due Diligence are \\nbriefly mentioned below: \\n239 | P a g e  \\n \\n1. Investment Strategy \\nThe stated Investment Strategy is analysed to check for the investment methodology and risk \\nfactors involved while investing in targeted securities, such as excessive limits on short \\npositions, excessive derivative-trading and concentration limits. In case of a Category III AIF, \\nleverage is also a crucial factor for investors, which may increase the potential risk of the Fund \\nportfolio, as seen in the classic case of Long Term Capital Management Fund, in USA. (see Box \\n7.1) \\nBox 7.1: Long Term Capital Management Case \\n \\nLong Term Capital Management (LTCM) was set-up by John Meriwether from Salomon \\nBrothers. The Fund had a very long track record of highly profitable relative-value \\nstrategies. It used to perform convergence trades in the European, Japanese and USA \\nSovereign Bond Markets, by purchasing relatively under-valued bonds and selling relatively \\nover-valued bonds. \\n \\nFor the fund to make significant profit, it needed to make many highly-leveraged positions. \\nThis was because the difference between the converging trades was miniscule. By 1998, \\nthe fund had equity of USD 5 billion and had borrowed over USD 125 billion, operating at a \\nleverage ratio of 30:1. \\n \\nThe Russian sovereign debt had defaulted in the summer of 1998, which drove a rapid flight \\nto quality in treasuries, and the source of their relative value profits turned into a significant \\nloss position. These losses were compounded by the high leverage taken by the fund. \\n \\nLTCM was forced to liquidate all holdings and close. There was fear that the downfall of \\nLTCM could have spiraling effects in the global financial markets, causing catastrophic \\nlosses throughout the financial system. Goldman Sachs, AIG and Berkshire Hathaway on \\nSeptember 23, 1998 offered to buy out the funds partners for USD 250 million and decided \\nto inject USD 3.75 billion and to operate LTCM within Goldman’s own trading division. The \\nfinal bailout was USD 3.65 billion. \\n \\nThe downside trigger on account of the Russian default caused the demise of LTCM due to \\nthe leverage deployed and the sheer size of their positions relative to the broader market. \\n \\n2. Investment Management Team \\nThe Investment Manager should have relevant exposure and experience in the same asset \\nclass of securities, in which the fund is making targeted investments as the investment \\nstrategy. Experience of minimum five years is compulsory, in investment management or \\ninvestment advisory services, as per the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, \\n2012. The minutes of the Investment Committee meetings should also be reviewed, to check \\nthe investment management and approval process adopted by the Fund. \\n240 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe past experience of the Investment Management team is also equally important. \\nInvestment Due Diligence should also include reviewing the past investment experience of \\nthe team inter-alia involved in equity research, trade execution, order management, sales, \\ncompliance and fund administration. \\n3. Manager Selection Process \\nManager Selection Process adopted by the Category III AIF is one of the most crucial factors \\nreviewed in an Investment Due Diligence process. Investment manager is a ‘Key Person’ of \\nthe Category III AIF and the investors should ensure that selection of the manager is done \\nthrough a proper screening and selection process. An informal process of appointment of the \\ninvestment manager may indicate that the fund is privately managed, by the sponsor and \\nmanager, without aligning the interest of the investors. \\n4. Past Track Record of the Investment Manager \\nHistorical Performance of the funds/investments previously managed by the Investment \\nManager should be thoroughly analysed. Potential investors in the Category III AIF should \\nanalyse the historical returns of the funds managed by the investment manager, over a \\nminimum of five years. Investors should verify if the investment manager had successfully \\nmanaged a sizeable fund corpus, provided stellar returns for investors in that fund and \\ninvested across the same asset classes and industries, as targeted by the Category III AIF. \\n5. Past Disciplinary History \\nThe Investment Manager and Sponsor of the Category III AIF, along-with its respective \\npartners, directors, associates and Trustees should not have a history of outstanding litigation \\ncases, where the person has been found guilty, for a minimum period of five years. Investors \\nshould also check for any history of criminal or civil prosecution, disputes, non-payment of \\nstatutory dues, past defaults against banks or financial institutions, proceedings initiated for \\neconomic offences or civil offences, any disciplinary action taken by SEBI or any other \\nregulatory authority, penalties levied and disputed tax liabilities to be paid thereof. \\n6. Key-Person Risk \\nIn a Category III AIF, the investment managers are key persons for the fund, making all the \\ninvestment decisions, fulfilling redemption requests, ensuring compliance and seamless trade \\nexecution. Any adverse event, such as death, insanity, incapacity or immovability of the \\ninvestment manager can significantly hamper the operational activities of the fund and \\nthereby, posing a threat to the net return earned by the investors. \\nInvestors, either directly or through their authorized representatives/consultants, should \\nhold on-site meetings with the investment manager and the entire team of investment \\nmanagement, trade execution, research and compliance. This can help the investor to analyse \\n241 | P a g e  \\n \\nthe functions of every member within the team and analyse if the fund is dependent on the \\nactions of only the investment manager. \\n7. Alignment of Interest  \\nThe inherent conflict of interests of a Category III AIF with its investors is a major concern and \\nraises a Red Flag in the Due Diligence process. Investment Managers of a Category III AIF \\nshould ensure that the interest of investors in the fund is not compromised at any point during \\nthe life-time of the fund, in order to make gains in the proprietary account of the investment \\nmanager or gains for affiliate entities of the fund. This is possible in the following manner: \\n• Making investments through the Category III AIF in such entities, in which the \\naffiliates, investment manager and other interested parties may have a previous \\nownership interest, whether or the same terms or otherwise. \\n• The Investment Manager should dedicate their time towards making investment \\nmanagement decisions for the Category III AIF. Allocation of time and resources \\nby the investment manager, amongst any other projects is a conflict. \\n• The Investment Manager may allocate potential investment opportunities, among \\nthe Category III AIF, other co-investors and other funds managed by the \\ninvestment manager. \\n• The Investment Manager may in its sole discretion offer other funds an \\nopportunity to co-invest along-with the Category III AIF in particular investments. \\nIf the terms on which co-investors participate in investments are different from \\nthe terms on which the Fund participates in those investments, there is a potential \\nconflict of interest.  \\nThe Investment Manager should avoid any such potential conflicts of interest, thereby \\naligning the interest of the investors with the fund.  \\n8. Fee Structure of the Fund \\nA higher fee-structure, if adopted, by the Investment manager should be justified by the past \\nperformance, industry exposure and reputation of the investment manager, in the domestic \\ncapital market. If the past performance is not significantly high, a higher fee structure would \\nbe undesirable and would be a potential risk factor for the investors. \\nInstitutional Investors would also review the fee structure applicable for all class of units to \\nbe issued by the Category III AIF. Investment Managers offering a fee structure with lower \\nManagement Fees and higher Incentive Fees may be preferred by some institutional \\ninvestors, based on their risk appetite. Other risk-averse investors may prefer the standard \\nrates for Management Fees and a lower Incentive Fee, to avoid taking excess risk. \\n \\n \\n242 | P a g e  \\n \\n9. Risk Factors and Leverage \\nRisk Factors mentioned in the Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) should be carefully \\nanalysed for any unnecessary risks and warranties claimed by the Fund. The investors should \\nhave the knowledge of permissible concentration limits, limits on short positions and limits \\non leverage taken by the Fund. A Fund may choose to have self-imposed restrictions on \\nsectoral limits, type of securities to invest in and targeted market segments, among others, \\nas per the PPM. SEBI has prescribed maximum leverage limits for a Category III AIF, in relation \\nto its Net Asset Value. \\n10. Risk Management Controls and Policies \\nRisk Management policies of the fund outline the procedures to be adopted by the Category \\nIII AIF, in case of any breach in prudential norms prescribed by SEBI and the team members \\nresponsible to do so. The internal controls on pay-in and pay-out of cash and securities should \\nbe carefully analysed, to ensure that adequate safety measures and authentication policies \\nare adopted by the fund, when executing trades. \\n11. Government Reforms and Taxation \\nGovernment Reforms in India have encouraged the growth of Category III AIFs. Investors \\nshould analyse the impact of current and expected government policies and taxation \\nstructures, on the net return of the fund and the distributions made to the investors. \\nCompliance with taxation policies and timely payment of indirect taxes and direct taxes is an \\nindicator of strong operational policies within the fund. \\n12. Macro-economic Factors  \\nEconomic cycles, global risk factors and political risks are crucial, for the Investment Strategy \\nof the Category III AIF to be implemented successfully. Investors should analyse the possibility \\nof negative returns and worst-case scenarios, such as war, pandemic, and domestic geo-\\npolitical risk factors impacting potential returns. \\n13. Regulatory Compliance and Legal Proceedings \\nInvestors should verify timely compliance of domestic regulatory norms, by the potential \\nCategory III AIF, in terms of Registration with the domestic regulator, compliance with \\nprudential and reporting norms and timely payment of applicable taxes. Any legal \\nproceedings against the fund may also result in contingent liabilities for the fund, thereby \\nimpacting the net distribution of funds to investors. \\n14. Business Operations and Internal Controls \\nEffective Operational Controls and Internal Controls are a pre-condition in today’s financial \\nmarkets, for managing investors’ money. A Category III AIF should document all the internal \\npolicies and processes for every department within the fund. The investors must ensure that \\n243 | P a g e  \\n \\nthe fund has all basic controls, such as maker-checker control and access controls when \\nhandling confidential data relating to the clients. \\n15. Engagements with Third-party Service Providers \\nAll Category III AIFs appoint external service providers such as a fund administrator, custodian, \\nregistrar and transfer agent, auditor, legal advisor, fund distributors, software developer and \\nother professional service providers. Investors should verify the potential conflicts of interests \\nwith all service providers, in form of related party transactions, understand the important \\nterms of contract and verify that the interests of the service providers are aligned with the \\ninterests of the investors in the Category III AIF. \\n16. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans \\nBusiness Continuity can be impacted, due to material Key-Person events or natural disasters. \\nThe investors should ensure that Category III AIFs have adequate business continuity plans \\nand policies, which outline the future course of action on account of unpredictable events. \\nDisaster Recovery Plans are also crucial for a Category III AIF with the increased use of \\ntechnology for the purpose of executing trades and maintaining client’s data. \\n17. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policies \\nInstitutional investors should analyse the ESG policies adopted by the fund. If a potential \\nCategory III AIF manager has a reputation of being unprofessional at workplace, not providing \\nadequate workplace safety to employee, then investors would prefer to not invest in the fund. \\nSimilarly, if a Category III AIF is unable to fulfil all the Corporate Governance requirements, \\nsuch as following transparency norms for timely disclosures of information to investors, \\nholding Investment Committee meetings on a timely basis or appointing independent \\ndirectors on the Board, the investors would prefer not to invest in the fund with inadequate \\ngovernance policies. Under the new stewardship code, released by SEBI, all Category III AIFs, \\nin collaboration with other institutional investors, are required to monitor and engage with \\nthe investee companies on ESG factors and monitor the inherent ESG risks at the investee \\ncompany level.  \\n18. Potential Conflicts of Interest \\nThe potential conflict of interests are identified by the Investment manager and disclosed in \\nthe PPM, before the investors commit capital. The conflicts may be internal conflicts with the \\nfund sponsor, investment manager, affiliates and trustees, or external conflicts, with \\ncustodians and third-party service providers. Investors should carefully analyse every \\npotential conflict and its impact on the estimated returns of the fund. Most Category III AIFs \\nhave a conflict resolution policy outlined in the PPM. \\n \\n \\n244 | P a g e  \\n \\n19. Transparency and Investor Reporting process \\nInstitutional Investors always prefer timely disclosure of information, relating to the \\ninvestments made by the fund, total short positions taken, concentration limits and total \\nleverage taken by the fund. The Category III AIFs should provide timely disclosures to the \\ninvestors, on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis, in the formats prescribed by SEBI. A \\nCategory III AIF may choose to report more frequently than the prescribed limits of quarterly \\nreporting or monthly reporting, to give comfort to investors. Category III AIFs which do not \\nundertake Leverage are required to submit reports on a quarterly basis to SEBI, within 10 \\ncalendar days from the end of each quarter in the revised format as specified by SEBI. \\nCategory III AIFs which undertake Leverage are required to submit reports on a monthly basis \\nto SEBI.  \\nThe investors conduct a thorough review of such other factors as necessary and conduct on-\\nsite visits, whenever possible, to physically verify the existence of staff members, policies and \\nprocedures claimed by the Category III AIF. Such process may be done internally, by \\nappointing a dedicated team of due diligence professionals, having industry experience in \\nlegal and financial domain. Alternatively, some small-size and mid-size institutional investors \\nmay choose to appoint third-party due diligence experts, with qualified and dedicated staff in \\nareas, inter-alia including investment management, finance, legal and regulatory compliance. \\nInvestment Due Diligence is performed by Institutional Investors, after screening potential \\nfunds, based on pre-determined risk-returns objectives, and short-listing the target Category \\nIII AIF for a potential investment. Due Diligence process should be ideally completed before \\nsigning legal documents and investment agreements, which binds the institutional investor \\nto commit capital to the fund. Timely completion of due diligence can allow the investor to \\nnegotiate the terms and conditions for subscription to the fund, based on the due diligence \\nreports and analysis. Some of the important legal documents signed or to be verified by \\ninstitutional investors and important points for consideration are outlined below: \\n• Subscription Agreement/ Contribution Agreement: \\nSubscription Agreement records the fund terms and conditions, distribution mechanism, list \\nof expenses to be borne by the fund and powers of the investment committee of the Category \\nIII AIF. The agreement sets out the capital commitment for investors and records the \\nrepresentations and warranties to be made by the investors, on their legal qualification to \\nmake investments in the fund. A potential investor shall verify all the terms and conditions \\nstated in the Subscription Agreement with the Private Placement Memorandum and check \\nfor any differences or discrepancies which may impact their rights or liabilities.  \\n• Advisory Agreement:  \\nA Category III AIF, based in an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) as per the SEBI \\n(International Financial Services Centre) Guidelines, 2015, such as Gujarat International \\n245 | P a g e  \\n \\nFinance Tec-City (GIFT), and foreign investors investing in Category III AIFs may choose to \\ndelegate the investment management and advisory function to a third-party, known as the \\nInvestment Advisor. The Investment Advisory Agreement contains the general terms under \\nwhich such investment advisor renders advise in respect of the transactions for the Fund’s \\nboard. A potential institutional investor shall review the professional qualification and \\nexperience of the third-party advisors appointed, the terms and conditions for such \\nappointment and any potential conflicts of interest.  \\n• Indenture of Trust: \\nThe Indenture of Trust, or “Trust Deed”, is an important document to determine the tax \\nliability of institutional investors and the beneficial ownership in the “Trust” structure of a \\nCategory III AIF. The document mentions the nature of the trust, being a “Determinate Trust” \\nor “Indeterminate Trust” and the applicability of tax rates, based on the trust structure. A \\npotential institutional investor shall review the Indenture of Trust to ascertain their legal \\nbeneficial ownership, in the Category III AIF which is structured as a trust. Such investors can \\nalso ascertain the applicable tax rates, on income earned on the investment, whether to be \\npaid by the fund or by the investor. \\n• Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) and Wrapper: \\nPPM outlines the investment thesis of a Category III AIF and summarizes the key terms on \\nwhich institutional investors could participate in the units issued by the scheme. Potential risk \\nfactors and conflicts of interest are also outlined in the PPM. A wrapper is a supplement \\nattached to the PPM, to help achieve compliance with the requirements for private placement \\nof the units issued by an offshore fund, as per the compliances and regulations applicable \\nwithin that jurisdiction. The PPM and Wrapper should be analyzed together, in order to \\nshortlist a potential Category III AIF, established outside India. \\n• Investor Side Letters: \\nInvestor Side Letters outline the preferential terms and exemptions provided to certain \\n“Class” of investors. Such class of investors may seek differential arrangements with respect \\nto lower management fee, participation in investment committee meetings or tax \\nexemptions. An institutional investor can negotiate Investor Side Letters, based on the Due \\nDiligence reports and analysis. \\nThe Investment manager shall take into consideration the terms and conditions at which units \\nare issued to investors. As per the Investor Side Letters, the fund may issue a unique “Class of \\nUnits” to those investors being offered differential terms to subscribe to the fund. However, \\nit is important to note that the investment manager of a Category III AIF has a fiduciary duty \\ntowards other investors in the fund. Hence, the investment manager should ensure that they \\nare not in breach of such fiduciary duty, in an attempt to provide differential rights to some \\n246 | P a g e  \\n \\nlarge investors. One large investor cannot be given priority over other investors, in case a \\nCategory III AIF is distributing losses accumulated in the fund. \\n \\n \\n247 | P a g e  \\n \\nChapter 7: Sample Questions \\n1.

NAV calculated on each ‘Valuation Day’ shall be disclosed to all investors on a \\nquarterly basis for closed-ended AIFs and on a monthly basis for open-ended AIFs. Investors \\nin the Category III AIF are to be provided with a description of the valuation procedure, the \\nmethodology of valuation and changes to such valuation methodology, if any, in relation to \\nthe Category III AIF. \\n \\nFor the purpose of understanding NAV, let us understand the following concepts: \\n• Valuation Day: The Valuation Day is pre-determined by a Category III AIF, and \\ncommunicated to the investors in its offer documents, as the day by reference to \\nwhich the NAV of the Category III AIF is determined. Valuation Day can be set in one \\nor more of the following ways: \\no NAV should be calculated at least once in a calendar month, for open-ended \\nCategory III AIFs, or at least once in a quarter for closed-ended Category III \\nAIFs, as on the last Business Day of such calendar month or quarter. In case a \\nCategory III AIF is investing in listed securities only, NAV is usually computed \\non a daily basis. \\no NAV should be calculated on the close of business of the last securities \\nmarket, on every Business Day, in which the fund deals or executes trades. \\nThis is done for the purpose of Mark-to-Market (MTM). \\no NAV can be computed at such intervals, as determined by the Investment \\nManager, for the purposes of a closing or for redemptions or distributions, as \\napplicable. Each such day is considered as a Valuation Day. \\n \\n• Class of Units: The number of ‘Units’ issued by a Category III AIF determine the \\n‘Beneficial Interest’ of every investor in that fund. Such Beneficial Interest is the basis \\n249 | P a g e  \\n \\nof making allocation of units or distributions to the investors, on liquidation or \\nredemption.  \\n \\nA Category III AIF may have differential rights assigned to a specific group of investors, \\nor a class of investors, based on quantum of Commitments, the time period for such \\ncommitments made by a class of investors and the proportion of such Commitments \\nto the Total Fund Corpus. In order to identify the investors with differential rights, \\nthe Category III AIF manager can issue different “Class of Units” to such class of \\ninvestors. Hence, a Category III AIF can issue a different Class of units, or a category \\nof units, to the Institutional Investors, Sponsor, employees of Investment Manager \\nand other investors with a Beneficial Interest in the Category III AIF.  \\n \\nThe categorization of units in different classes is at the discretion of the Investment \\nManager. One illustration of issuing different Class of units is shown below: \\nIllustration: \\nClass A, Class B and Class C units are issued to the investors and divided into various sub-\\nclasses depending on the quantum of the Capital Commitment made by such investors, \\nwhether individually or in association with other investors including their respective \\nrelatives, trust entities or company. The minimum contribution from every investor shall be \\nRs. 1 crore. \\nClass D, Class E and Class F units are issued to the Sponsor, employees of the Investment \\nManager, members of the Investment Management Team and friends, family or relatives of \\nthe members of the investment Team. \\nClass A units can be divided into various sub-classes, depending on the quantum of \\nManagement Fees payable, as described below are issued as follows: \\nClass of \\nUnits  \\nCapital Commitment \\nManagement \\nFee (p.a.) \\nClass A1 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or more than Rs. 1 \\ncrore but less than Rs.5 crore \\n2.50% \\nClass A2 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or more than Rs. 5 \\ncrore but less than Rs. 10 crore \\n2.10% \\nClass A3 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or above Rs. 10 \\ncrore \\n1.75% \\n \\nClass B units can be divided into various sub-classes, depending on the quantum of \\nManagement Fees and Incentive Fees payable, as described below: \\n250 | P a g e  \\n \\nClass of \\nUnits  \\nCapital Commitment \\nManagement \\nFee (p.a.) \\nIncentive \\nFees \\nClass B1 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or more than Rs. 1 \\ncrore but less than Rs. 5 crore \\n1.75% \\n15% \\nClass B2 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or more than Rs. 5 \\ncrore but less than Rs. 10 crore \\n1.40% \\n15% \\nClass B3 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or above Rs. 10 \\ncrore \\n1.10% \\n15% \\n \\nClass C units can be divided into various sub-classes, depending on the quantum of \\nManagement Fees and Incentive Fees payable, as described below: \\nClass of \\nUnits  \\nCapital Commitment \\nManagement \\nFee (p.a.) \\nIncentive \\nFees \\nClass C1 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or more than Rs. 1 \\ncrore but less than Rs. 10 crore \\n1.25% \\n- \\nClass C2 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or above Rs. 10 \\ncrore \\n1.00% \\n- \\nClass C3 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or above Rs. 10 \\ncrore \\n0.75% \\n15% \\n \\nClass D Units shall be issued to the Sponsor of the Category III AIF, and/or such person as the \\nInvestment Manager may designate on making the Capital Contribution.  \\nClass E Units shall be issued to partners and employees of the Investment Manager and/or \\nemployee welfare trust established by the Category III AIF, and/or such person as the \\nInvestment Manager may designate on making the Capital Contribution.  \\nClass F Units shall be issued to friends, family or relatives of the members of the investment \\nTeam and/or such person as the Investment Manager may designate, and can be divided \\ninto various sub-classes, depending on the quantum of Management Fees and Additional \\nReturn payable, as described below: \\nClass of \\nUnits  \\nCapital Commitment \\nManagement \\nFee (p.a.) \\nIncentive \\nFees \\nClass F1 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or more than Rs. 1 \\ncrore but less than Rs. 10 crore \\n1.50% \\n- \\n251 | P a g e  \\n \\nClass F2 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or above Rs. 10 \\ncrore \\n1.25% \\n- \\nClass F3 \\nUnits \\nCapital Commitment equal to or above Rs. 10 \\ncrore \\n0.75% \\n15% \\n \\nThe Investment Manager may cause the Category III AIF to issue further Class of units in the \\nfuture, which will have the same underlying portfolio but may have varied fee structure as \\nthe Investment Manager may decide in its sole discretion.  \\n• Series: A Series of a particular Class of units is distinct and exclusive from another \\nseries of the same Class of units. In order to identify different class of investors, the \\nInvestment Manager may create a series within the same class of units.  \\n \\nContinuing the previous illustration, in the first close of the Category III AIF, all \\ninvestors making Capital Commitments of more than Rs. 5 crore and less than Rs. 10 \\ncrore can be allocated a distinct Series, but within Class A2 units only. \\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) for every unit of the Category III AIF is obtained by dividing the \\nnet value of the assets attributable to each class/sub-class of units, as reduced by net \\nliabilities, contingencies, losses and expenses attributable to such class/sub-class of units, by \\nthe total number of units issued to the unit holders and rounded upto four decimal places. \\nThe NAV per unit shall be calculated separately for each class of units or a Series of units.  \\nThe Fund’s assets comprise the following: \\n• All cash and bank account holdings, plus earned interest; \\n• All securities and investments owned by the Fund; \\n• All dividends and distributions receivable in cash or otherwise \\n• All interest earned on interest-bearing securities held by the Fund \\n• All financial rights relating to the use of derivative instruments \\n• The Fund’s provisional expenses where these have not been written off, provided \\nthat they can be directly written off against the Fund’s capital; and \\n• All other assets of any kind and composition, including prepaid expenditure. \\nThe Fund’s liabilities comprise the following: \\n• All borrowings and other amounts due \\n• Tax expense as allocated to the investor’s account, in accordance with the \\nContribution Agreement \\n• All administrative expenses payable or incurred, including establishment and \\nregistration costs payable to registration agents; legal fees; audit fees; fees payable \\n252 | P a g e  \\n \\nto the Investment Manager and all other fees, charges, or expenses listed out in \\nthe Private Placement Memorandum \\n• All known liabilities, whether due or not yet due, including dividends declared but \\nnot yet paid \\n• All other liabilities of any kind to third parties \\nDetermination of Total Value of Assets and Liabilities of a Category III AIF: \\nThe assets and liabilities of a Category III AIF are valued in accordance with the Indian \\nAccounting Standards: \\n• Securities traded on a stock exchange or other regulated markets are to be valued at \\nthe closing price quoted on the relevant exchange or market, as on the relevant \\nValuation Day.  \\n \\n• Unlisted equity securities should be valued initially at cost and thereafter the \\nindependent valuer, appointed by the Trustee or the Investment Manager, will value \\nthe unquoted investments at Fair Market Value of such securities, as on the relevant \\nValuation Day. \\n \\n• Unlisted securities other than equities, for which there is an ascertainable market, \\nvaluation will be done at the closing price dealt on the market on which the securities \\nare traded, on the relevant Valuation Day.  \\n \\nFor unlisted securities for which there is no ascertainable market, valuation will be \\ndone at amortized cost of such security, plus interest (if any) accrued from the date \\nof such purchase. \\n• The value of units held in any unit trust, mutual fund, Investment Corporation, or \\nother similar investment vehicle shall be derived from the last prices published by \\nthe managers thereof, on the relevant Valuation Day. \\n \\n• The value of any cash in hand or on deposit, bills and demand notes and accounts \\nreceivable, prepaid expenses, cash dividends and interest accrued and not yet \\nreceived shall be deemed to be the full amount thereof, unless it is unlikely to be paid \\nor received in full. \\n• Determination of NAV should be done in Indian Rupee (INR). Any investment made \\nin a currency, otherwise than in INR shall be converted into INR at closing market \\nrate, on the relevant Valuation Day. \\n \\n• The realisation value of futures or options contracts officially listed on a market or \\ntraded on a regulated market shall be determined on the basis of the latest available \\nsettlement prices of these contracts on the stock exchanges and market on which \\n253 | P a g e  \\n \\nthe Fund trades the contracts.  \\n \\n• The realisation value of futures or options contracts not officially listed on a market \\nor traded on an unregulated market should be the net realisable value as determined \\nby a method determined by the independent valuer.  \\n \\nLet us understand the computation of NAV, with the help of an example: \\n \\nExample 1: \\n \\nFund INC has made investments across different asset classes. On January 01, 2020, the \\nInvestment Manager raised Rs. 50 crore, by issuing 5,00,000 units at an NAV of Rs. 1,000 per \\nunit. The assets and liabilities of the fund, as on Valuation Date June 30, 2020, are stated \\nbelow. Calculate the NAV of the Fund and analyse the investments. \\n \\nParticulars \\nQuantity \\nRate (Rs.) \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nASSETS: \\n \\n \\n \\nListed Equities: \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany ABC \\n50,000 \\n840.00 \\n4,20,00,000.00  \\nCompany XYZ \\n1,00,000 \\n1190.00 \\n11,90,00,000.00  \\nCompany PQC \\n10,00,000 \\n150.00 \\n15,00,00,000.00  \\nCompany LMN \\n75,000 \\n2250.00 \\n16,87,50,000.00 \\nUnlisted Equities (Fair Market Value): \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany SME \\n1,50,000 \\n110.00 \\n1,65,00,000.00 \\nUnlisted Debt Investments: \\n \\n \\n \\nCorporate Bonds issued by RCE Ltd. \\nFace Value -Rs.10,000, Coupon Rate – 9% \\n1,000  \\n105.00  \\n10,50,00,000.00  \\nUnits in Equity-oriented Mutual Funds: \\n \\n \\n \\nUnits of Equity Fund - EAMC \\n10,00,000  \\n23.75  \\n2,37,50,000.00  \\nCash and Receivables: \\n \\n \\n \\nCash-in-hand \\n \\n \\n2,50,000.00  \\nReceivable - Dividend Income \\n \\n \\n50,00,000.00  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTOTAL ASSETS \\n \\n \\n63,02,50,000.00  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLIABILITIES AND EXPENSES: \\n \\n \\n \\nAnnual Charges payable to Service Providers \\n \\n \\n1,50,00,000.00  \\nTax Liabilities \\n \\n \\n1,23,50,000.00  \\nSalaries and Administrative Expenses \\n \\n \\n1,00,00,000.00  \\nFees Payable - Management Fees \\n \\n \\n60,00,000.00  \\nFees Payable - Incentive Fees \\n \\n \\n1,02,00,000.00  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTOTAL LIABILITIES \\n \\n \\n5,35,50,000.00  \\nNo. of Units issued \\n \\n \\n5,00,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n254 | P a g e  \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nNAV = Total Assets – Total Liabilities \\n \\n      No. of Units Issued  \\n \\nNAV = Rs. 63,02,50,000 – Rs. 5,35,50,000 \\n \\n \\n5,00,000 \\n \\nNAV = Rs. 57,67,00,000 \\n \\n5,00,000 \\n \\nNAV = Rs. 1153.40 \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n• Listed Equities are valued based on the closing prices of the stocks, as on June 30, \\n2020, on a recognized stock exchange.  \\n \\n• Unlisted Investment in Company SME is taken based on the Fair Market Value, derived \\nfrom the valuation done by the independent Registered Valuer appointed by the Fund. \\n \\n• Unlisted investment in debt securities is done based on the ‘Amortized Cost’ of the \\nbond. Amortized Cost is derived by taking the purchase cost, after adjusting the \\ndiscount/premium on purchase of such bond, throughout the maturity period of the \\nbond. Assuming no interest is accrued from the date of purchase of the bond, \\nvaluation is done at the Amortized Cost without adding any interest income. \\n \\n• Investment in Fund EAMC is based on the NAV of the fund published by the \\nInvestment Manager, as on June 30, 2020. \\n \\n• Cash-in-hand and Dividend Receivable is taken as per actuals. Dividend declared but \\nnot received is an asset for the fund, and eventually an income. \\n \\n• Liabilities are taken as declared by the Fund. Expenses incurred on behalf of the fund, \\nsuch as Fees payable to the Investment Manager, salaries, administrative expenses \\nand annual charges payable to Service Providers are also taken into account for \\ncomputing the NAV. \\n \\n• The NAV as increased from Rs. 1,000, as on January 01, 2020 to Rs. 1153.40 as on June \\n30, 2020. \\n \\n• The NAV calculation is done based on the information provided in the Statement of \\nAssets and Liabilities. Any contingent liabilities accruing to the fund, such as potential \\nmarket risks, legal suits and foreign exchange movements can also be taken into \\nconsideration. \\n \\n \\n255 | P a g e  \\n \\nMark-to-Market \\n \\nMark-to-Market is the process of valuing the Category III AIF portfolio, based on the fair \\nmarket value of every security i.e. marking the securities to the market value, on a periodical \\nbasis. The Fair Market Value of all securities is determined on every Valuation Day and the \\nNAV is accordingly revised to represent the ‘true-worth’ of the fund portfolio, as on that day. \\nThe Marked-to-Market NAV is disclosed to investors on a periodical basis, to determine the \\nreturn earned on investments. Unless Mark-to-Market process is done on a periodical basis, \\nthe fund portfolio will continue to be valued at the Cost at which the security was bought, \\nespecially when valuing unlisted securities.  \\n \\nIncentive Fees payable to the Investment Manager is based on the return earned by the \\nCategory III AIF, using current market prices. Mark-to-Market process is crucial for the \\nInvestment Manager and investors, to determine the fair amount of Incentive Fees payable, \\nas on a particular Valuation Day. Further, Mark-to-Market ensures fair practice in redemption \\nor withdrawal of units of a Category III AIF scheme. The price at which an investor shall \\nredeem or withdraw the scheme units will be determined by the Marked-to-Market NAV. \\nSince Category III AIFs invest in derivative contracts, it becomes essential for the Investment \\nManager to follow Daily Mark-to-Market process, for reconciliation of margin accounts with \\nbrokers and representing a Fair Value of the Portfolio.  \\n \\nLet us continue with our example of Fund INC and ascertain the importance of Mark-to-\\nMarket. \\n \\nExample 2: \\n \\nFund INC has made investments across different asset classes. On January 01, 2020, the \\nInvestment Manager raised Rs. 50 crore, by issuing 5,00,000 units at an NAV of Rs. 1,000 per \\nunit.

Unlisted Investment in Company SME is taken based \\non the Fair Market Value, derived from the valuation done by the independent \\nRegistered Valuer appointed by the Fund. \\n \\n• It is observed that the Fund has sold part holding in unlisted shares of Company SME \\nand listed shares of Company PQC. Market Prices of other companies have increased \\nin the last month, which resulted in the increase of NAV, as on July 31, 2020. \\n \\n• Unlisted investment in debt securities is done based on the Amortized Cost of the \\nbond. The Market Price of such bonds can be derived from OTC debt market trades. \\n \\n• Investment in Fund EAMC is based on the NAV of the fund published by the \\nInvestment Manager, as on July 31, 2020. The Fund INC has sold part of the holding in \\nFund EAMC and invested the proceeds in Fund MAMC. \\n257 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Previous Liabilities of the Fund are paid from dividends receivables and sale proceeds \\nfrom equity shares. Liabilities of management fees and tax liabilities are paid-off. \\nAdditional liabilities in the current month, of GST and Capital Gain Tax provision, have \\nbeen taken into account to compute the NAV. \\n \\n• The NAV has increased substantially and Marked-to-Market with the market values, \\nas on July 31, 2020. This valuation is based on Fair Market Prices and makes a good \\nproposition for payment of Incentive Fees to the Investment Manager. \\n \\n8.2 Valuation Techniques \\n \\nAs seen in the previous topic, a Category III AIF can invest across multiple asset classes such \\nas Equities, Mutual Funds, Fixed Income Securities and Derivatives. Investments may be made \\nby the Category III AIF in liquid securities as well as illiquid securities. All these asset classes \\nhave distinct features and therefore require the Category III AIF to use different techniques \\nto value the NAV based on the underlying asset class in the portfolio. \\n \\n8.2.1 Portfolio of Liquid and Illiquid Securities \\n \\nLiquid securities have a ready market for trades, with a large number of buyers and sellers \\nand have a large volume of trades executed, on a daily basis, by the market participants. \\nTherefore, such securities are redeemable at the Fair Market Value (FMV), as on a specific \\nValuation Day. On the contrary, the market for illiquid securities has a small number of buyers \\nand sellers for trade execution and has a relatively small volume of trades executed, on a daily \\nbasis. The investments in illiquid securities may not be redeemable at its Fair Market Value, \\nas on a specific Valuation Day.  \\n \\nThe valuation methods to be used for computing the Fair Market Value of liquid securities \\nshall be clearly stated in the Valuation Policy of the Category III AIF. Liquid Securities can be \\nvalued using the methods discussed above, by taking the fair market value of listed equities, \\nmutual fund units, exchange-traded derivatives and fixed income securities. \\n \\nHowever, valuation of illiquid securities shall not be done on the basis of the Fair Market Value \\nof the security. The Investment Manager shall clearly state the Valuation Method adopted by \\nthe fund for the valuation of illiquid securities, approved by an independent registered valuer. \\nOne such method of valuing illiquid securities is discounting the future Fair Market Value of \\nan illiquid security. An illiquid security, such as stocks of an SME or thinly-traded company, \\nhave a relatively small trading volume due to which the Investment Manager of a Category III \\nAIF may not be able to redeem all the holdings in one trade or deal. This impacts the future \\nfair market value, or net redeemable price of such illiquid securities. Based on the total \\nholding of such illiquid securities and the daily trading volume, the manager should ascertain \\nthe future impact on stock price and the net proceeds on redemption, thereon. \\n \\nLet us understand an example of Valuation of an Illiquid Security, with the help of the \\nfollowing example. \\n258 | P a g e  \\n \\nExample 3: \\n \\nFund ILS has made investment of Rs. 50 lakhs in Company ASME. Using the data provided as \\non T-day (Valuation Day), ascertain the Fair Market Value to be taken, for the purpose of \\nvaluing the stock:  \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount \\nTotal Shares purchased in Company ASME \\n2,00,000 \\nTotal Outstanding Shares in Company ASME \\n1,00,00,000 \\nFace Value \\nRe. 1.00 \\nMarket Price (FMV on T-day) \\nRs. 25/share \\nDaily Trading Volume (in shares) \\n50,000 \\nDaily Price Band \\n+/- 2% \\nCost of Capital (Opportunity Cost for Fund) \\n12% p.a. \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nCurrent Market Price of one share of Company ASME is Rs. 25, being traded on an SME \\nExchange. However, for the purpose of computing NAV of Fund ILS, the Fair Market Value of \\nRs. 25 should not be taken, due to the illiquidity in the market and lower trading volume of \\nthe stock. \\n \\nTotal Shares Held by Fund ILS = 2,00,000 shares \\n(Corresponding to a 2% holding in Company ASME) \\n \\nDaily Trading Volume = 50000 shares \\n \\nIf Fund ILS would want to sell all shares in Company ASME, it would take minimum 4 trading \\ndays for the Fund to execute “SELL” orders for the entire holding. (200000 shares / 50000 \\nshares) \\n \\nHence, the Sale Price for all 2,00,000 shares executed on four trading days would be as \\nfollows, assuming the Lower Price Band for the share due to Large Sale: \\n \\nParticulars \\nT Day \\nT+1 Day \\nT+2 Day \\nT+3 Day \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNumber of shares sold \\n50,000 \\n50,000 \\n50,000 \\n50,000 \\nMarket Price (Rs.) \\n25.00 \\n24.50 \\n24.01 \\n23.53 \\nNet Proceeds \\n12,50,000 \\n12,25,000 \\n12,00,500 \\n11,76,500 \\nPresent Value of Net \\nProceeds as on T-Day \\n(Valuation Day) \\n12,50,000 \\n12,24,412 \\n11,99,348 \\n11,74,807 \\n \\nTotal PV of Net Proceeds           =    Rs.48,48,568 \\nTotal Shares held by Fund ILS   =    Rs.2,00,000 \\n259 | P a g e  \\n \\nFair Value of Share of Company ASME =Rs. 24.2428 per share \\n \\nIt can be observed that the Fair Market Value of shares of Company ASME has reduced \\nsubstantially from Rs. 25 per share to Rs. 24.2428 per share. The valuation of shares has \\ndropped by more than 3%. This is primarily due to inherent illiquidity and the subsequent fall \\nin prices of the securities. If the Fund executes SELL trades in four continuous days, then Net \\nProceeds from the shares will be affected due to drop in price of the shares. \\n \\nNote: \\n• Market Price of the stock has been computed by reducing 2% from the previous day’s \\nclosing price. This is under the assumption that the stock has hit its lower price band \\nfor one trading day, with no further trades on the specific trading day. \\n• Net Proceeds for each trading day is computed, assuming that Fund ILS has been able \\nto successfully place SELL orders for all 50000 shares in one single trading day. \\n• It is necessary to compute the present value of the net proceeds from the trades, to \\nbe received on T+1 day, T+2 day and T+3 day, as the Valuation Day taken in our \\nexample is T-day. \\n• For the purpose of computing Present Value of Net Proceeds, the discounting factor \\nis computed for one trading day, by taking the Opportunity Cost of capital of 0.048% \\nper day, i.e. 12% per annum, and assuming 250 trading days in a year. \\n \\n8.2.2 Positions in Commodity Derivatives and Equity Derivatives Markets \\n \\nA Category III AIF is permitted to trade in Equity Derivatives contracts and Commodity \\nDerivatives contracts, such as Commodity Futures and Commodity Options, up to a prescribed \\nlimit of 10 percent of its investable funds in one underlying commodity. 130 Commodity \\nFutures are available on recognized stock exchanges, with standard contract terms, lot sizes, \\nprices and expiry date. Commodity options are available for trade on recognized stock \\nexchanges, as a second-order derivative contract with commodity futures as its underlying \\nasset. \\n \\nA Category III AIF can enter into a Futures contract to buy or sell an underlying asset, at a \\nfuture date, at a pre-determined price. In a futures contract, the fund has the obligation to \\nbuy or sell the contract, for final physical settlement, at the pre-specified date and pre-\\nspecified price. A buy position or a “Long Position” states that the fund will purchase the \\nunderlying asset, at the pre-specified date and pre-specified price, indicating that the \\ninvestment manager estimates the price of the underlying asset to increase in future. \\nSimilarly, sell position or a “Short Position” states that the fund will sell the underlying asset, \\nat the pre-specified date and pre-specified price, indicating that the manager estimates the \\nprice of the underlying asset to decrease in future. A Category III AIF can deal in: \\n• “Stock Futures”, wherein the underlying asset is a stock of a specific company. \\n• “Index Futures”, wherein the underlying asset is an Equity-based Index. \\n                                                          \\n \\n130 SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DMP/CIR/P/2017/61 dated June 21, 2017 on Participation of Category \\nIII Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) in the commodity derivatives market. \\n260 | P a g e  \\n \\n• “Commodity Futures”, wherein the underlying asset is a single commodity product \\nsuch as Precious Metals, Base Metals, Energy Products or Agricultural Products. \\nLike a Futures Contract, a Category III AIF can enter into an Options contract, wherein the \\nfund has a right but no obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset, at a future date, at a pre-\\ndetermined price. Buying a “Call option” is similar to taking a Long position in Futures; \\nhowever the Investment Manager will not have the obligation to “buy” the underlying asset \\nat expiry of the contract. Similarly, buying a “Put Option” is similar to taking a Short position \\nin Futures; however the Investment Manager will not have the obligation to “sell” the \\nunderlying asset at expiry of the contract. A Category III AIF can deal in: \\n \\n• “Stock Options”, wherein the underlying asset is a stock of a specific company. \\n• “Index Options”, wherein the underlying asset is an Equity-based Index. \\n• “Commodity Options”, wherein the underlying is the right to enter into a Commodity \\nFutures contract, having the same underlying commodity asset as the Option contract. \\n \\nAs already discussed in section 5.6.3 of Unit 5, a Category III AIF may take Leverage through \\ninvestments in derivative contracts, provided: \\n \\n• Prior consent of investors in the fund is taken \\n• Maximum Leverage should be2 times of the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Fund.  \\n• Disclosures are made to investors and SEBI periodically. \\n \\nFor the purpose of limiting Leverage taken by the Fund, SEBI has laid the ratio to compute the \\nmaximum permissible Leverage by the Fund, as under: \\n \\nLeverage = Total exposure {Long positions + Short positions (after offsetting as permitted)} \\nNet Asset Value (NAV) \\n \\n• Total exposure will be calculated as the sum of the market value of the long and short \\npositions of all securities / contracts held by the fund;  \\n• Idle cash and cash equivalents are excluded while calculating exposure; \\n• Temporary borrowing arrangements which relate to and are fully covered by capital \\ncommitments from investors are excluded from the calculation of leverage;  \\n• Offsetting of positions shall be allowed for calculation of leverage in accordance with \\nthe SEBI norms for hedging and portfolio rebalancing;  \\n• Category III AIFs investing in units of other AIFs may undertake leverage not \\nexceeding two times the NAV, which excludes the value of investment in units of \\nother AIFs.131 \\n \\nValuation of Derivative positions is done by computing the “Total Exposure” with the \\nfollowing: \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n131 As per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD-I/DF6/P/CIR/2021/584 dated June 25, 2021 \\n261 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Exposure in Futures Contracts: On date of entering into a futures contract (T-day), the \\nFutures Price at which a Category III AIF enters into a contract and the number of \\ncontracts entered into is taken for the purpose of computing Total Exposure. For all \\nsubsequent Valuation Days, mark-to-market process is followed to represent the Fair \\nMarket Value of the underlying asset, in the Futures Contract.  \\n• Exposure in Options Contracts: On date of entering into an options contract (T-day), \\nthe Total Exposure is computed as the Option Premium paid for entering into the \\nOption Contract. For all subsequent Valuation Days, Black-Scholes Model and the \\nmark-to-market process is followed for pricing the Options contract at Fair Market \\nValue.  \\n \\nAs per the Black-Scholes Model, the price of the Option, i.e. the Option Premium, is \\ncalculated based on the underlying asset price, exercise price, inherent volatility in \\nasset price, changes in interest rates and time period to Option Expiry. A change in the \\nOption Premium indicates the change in the probability of the option being in-the-\\nmoney132, or generating a profit, at expiry. \\n \\n• Margin: For entering into a derivative contract, the Category III AIF will need to deposit \\nthe required applicable margins (SPAN Margin, Exposure Margin, VaR Margin, \\nExtreme Loss Margin, Initial Margin and Mark-to-Market Margin) with the respective \\nbroker and central counter-party. Such deposits with brokers are taken as an “Asset” \\nfor the purpose of computing the NAV of a Category III AIF. Any changes in the \\nunderlying prices of futures and options contracts will impact the margin accounts, i.e. \\na loss on F&O activity will result in additional “Liability” towards the margin and a \\nprofit on F&O activity will result in an increase in the balance of the margin accounts, \\nhence an “Asset”. \\n \\n• Calculation of Total Exposure: Total Exposure of the Fund is computed by adding the \\nexposure in all long positions, i.e. Long Futures and Call Options, and exposure in short \\npositions, i.e. Short Futures and Put Options. If a Category III AIF has taken a long \\nposition as well as taken short position in the same stock, index or commodity, with \\nthe same maturity period, such positions can be offset with each other to compute \\nthe net exposure towards the single stock, index or commodity.  \\n \\n• NAV and Leverage: The maximum exposure permitted towards derivative contracts is \\n2 times the NAV of the Category III AIF. The Investment Manager should be \\nresponsible to maintain the required Leverage Limits and ensure that Total Exposure \\ntowards derivatives, after offsetting positions, does not surpass twice the amount of \\nthe NAV. Moreover, during the mark-to-market process, the Investment Manager \\nshould ensure that total exposure does not breach the Leverage Limits, due to an \\nincrease/decrease in the price of the underlying asset. \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n132 ‘Moneyness’ refers to the intrinsic value of an option, based on the current futures contract price of the \\nunderlying asset, as on one trading day. A call option is “in-the-money” when the future contract price is above \\nthe strike price. Similarly, the call option is “out-of-the-money” when the future contract price is below the strike \\nprice. A call option is “at-the-money” when the future contract price is equal to the strike price. \\n262 | P a g e  \\n \\nLet us understand valuation of Derivatives and mark-to-market process with the example of \\nFund INC being continued: \\n \\nExample 4: \\n \\nFund INC has made investments across different asset classes.

This is also due to the benefit of off-\\nsetting positions taken in NIFTY50 Options, as the contracts have the same expiry.  \\n• Opposite positions are taken in NIFTY50 options, but with different exercise prices. \\nThis is majorly done to hedge the risk of NIFTY index going below the levels of 9000 \\nand also gain from upward movements in NIFTY, above the levels of 9700. \\n• A significant drop in the NAV is observed, primarily on account of payment of margin \\nfor the futures contracts and the option premium on NIFTY50 Options. The Balance \\nmaintained with Brokers in the F&O Margin Account will reduce, as follows: \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nOpening Balance as on May 16, 2020 \\n11,00,00,000.00 \\nLess: Margin payable for Gold Futures  \\n(1,57,78,800.00) \\nLess: Margin payable for Stock LMN Futures \\n(5,49,15,900.00) \\nLess: Total Option Premium on NIFTY50 Options \\n(1,35,00,000.00) \\nBalance as on May 16, 2020 at 09:20 AM \\n2,58,05,300.00 \\n \\n• Practically, derivative trades are not executed by the broker, till the Margin Money is \\ndeposited by the investment manager, in the Margin Account maintained with the \\nbroker. As is evident from the example, Fund INC is maintaining sufficient balance in \\nthe F&O Margin Account maintained with the broker, in order to execute the trade. \\n \\n \\n \\n266 | P a g e  \\n \\nMark-to-market of Derivatives: \\n \\nMark-to-Market is the process of valuing the Category III AIF portfolio, based on the fair \\nmarket value of every security i.e. marking the securities to the market value, on a periodical \\nbasis. The same process is followed for derivative contracts. Option contracts are exercised \\nat the Expiry of the contract. However, changes in the value of the futures contract are \\nmarked-to-market on a daily basis, to check for daily profit or loss and adjust the balance in \\nthe margin account, accordingly. \\n \\nLet us continue the previous example of Fund INC to compute the Mark-to-Market profit or \\ngain and the consequent NAV. \\n \\nExample 5:  \\n \\nFund INC had bought the following contracts on May 16, 2020 at 9:15:15 AM \\n \\nIndex Options: Bought \\nParticulars \\nNo. of \\nLots \\nLot-\\nsize \\nPremium \\n(Rs.) \\nNotional \\nExposure (Rs.) \\nTotal Premium \\n(Rs.) \\nNifty 9000 - PE \\nExp - 25JUN2020 \\n300 \\n75 \\n380 \\n85,50,000 \\n85,50,000 \\nNifty 9700 - CE  \\nExp - 25JUN2020 \\n600 \\n75 \\n110 \\n49,50,000 \\n49,50,000 \\n \\nFutures Contracts in Stocks and Commodities – Short Positions \\nParticulars \\nNo. of \\nLots \\nLot-size \\nFutures \\nPrice (Rs.) \\nNotional \\nExposure (Rs.) \\nTotal Margin \\n(Rs.) \\nInvestment LMN \\nExp - 25JUN2020 \\n300 \\n250 \\n2275 \\n17,06,25,000 \\n5,49,15,900 \\nGold Futures \\nExp– 5AUG2020 \\n50 \\n100 \\n(1000 gm) \\n47550 \\n23,77,50,000 \\n1,57,78,800 \\n \\nClosing Futures Prices of underlying assets, as on May 16, 2020 at 04:00:00 PM are given \\nbelow: \\n \\nParticulars \\nFutures Price (Rs.) \\nInvestment LMN \\nExp - 25JUN2020 \\n2150.00 \\nGold Futures \\nExp– 5AUG2020 \\n46760.00 \\n \\nCompute the Mark-to-Market Profit/Loss and NAV as on May 16, 2020, assuming the \\nfollowing closing prices of other investments: \\n267 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars \\nClosing Price (Rs.) \\nCompany ABC \\n865.00 \\nCompany PQC \\n165.00 \\nCompany LMN \\n2145.00 \\nCompany SME \\n125.00 \\nCorporate Bonds \\nissued by RCE Ltd. \\n105.00 \\nUnits of Equity Fund - \\nEAMC \\n23.78 \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nComputation of Mark-to-Market Profit on Short Positions – as on May 16, 2020 \\n \\nParticulars \\n(1) \\nNo. of \\nLots \\n(2) \\nLot-\\nsize \\n(3) \\nFutures Price (Rs.)  \\nat 4:00 PM \\n(4) \\nFutures Price (Rs.) \\nat 9:15:15 AM \\n(5) \\nUnrealized \\nProfit/(Loss) \\n(6) \\n[(5)-(4)]*(2)*(3) \\nInvestment \\nLMN \\nExp - \\n25JUN2020 \\n300 \\n250 \\n2150.00 \\n2275.00 \\n93,75,000 \\nGold \\nFutures \\nExp– \\n5AUG2020 \\n50 \\n100 \\n(1000 \\ngm) \\n46760.00 \\n47550.00 \\n39,50,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTotal  \\n1,33,25,000 \\n \\n \\nComputation of MTM NAV – as on May 16, 2020 \\n \\nParticulars \\nQuantity \\nRate (Rs.) \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nASSETS: \\n \\n \\n \\nListed Equities: \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany ABC \\n50,000 \\n865.00 \\n4,32,50,000.00  \\nCompany PQC \\n10,00,000 \\n165.00 \\n16,50,00,000.00  \\nCompany LMN \\n75,000 \\n2145.00 \\n16,08,75,000.00 \\nUnlisted Equities (Fair Market \\nValue): \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany SME \\n1,50,000 \\n125.00 \\n1,87,50,000.00 \\nUnlisted Debt Investments: \\n \\n \\n \\nCorporate Bonds issued by RCE Ltd. \\nFace Value -Rs. 10,000, Coupon Rate \\n– 9% \\n1,000  \\n105.00  \\n10,50,00,000.00  \\nUnits in Equity-oriented Mutual \\nFunds: \\n \\n \\n \\n268 | P a g e  \\n \\nUnits of Equity Fund - EAMC \\n10,00,000  \\n23.78 \\n2,37,80,000.00  \\nCash and Receivables: \\n \\n \\n \\nBalance with Brokers – F&O Margin \\nAccount \\n \\n \\n3,91,30,300.00 \\nCash-in-hand \\n \\n \\n2,50,000.00  \\nReceivable - Dividend Income \\n \\n \\n50,00,000.00  \\nTOTAL ASSETS \\n \\n \\n56,10,35,300.00  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLIABILITIES AND EXPENSES: \\n \\n \\n \\nAnnual Charges payable to Service \\nProviders \\n \\n \\n1,50,00,000.00  \\nTax Liabilities \\n \\n \\n1,23,50,000.00  \\nSalaries and Administrative Expenses \\n \\n \\n1,00,00,000.00  \\nFees Payable - Management Fees \\n \\n \\n60,00,000.00  \\nFees Payable - Incentive Fees \\n \\n \\n1,02,00,000.00  \\nTOTAL LIABILITIES \\n \\n \\n5,35,50,000.00  \\nNo. of Units issued \\n \\n \\n5,00,000 \\nNAV \\n \\n \\n1014.9706 \\n \\nNotes: \\n• The NAV has increased from Rs. 957.0106 to Rs. 1014.9706, as on closing hours of May \\n16, 2020, on account of Mark-to-Market Gains on the Derivatives Positions being \\nadded to the F&O Margin Account maintained with the Broker, as under: \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nBalance as on May 16, 2020 at 09:20 AM \\n2,58,05,300.00 \\nAdd: Mark-to-Market Profit in Gold Futures \\n39,50,000.00 \\nAdd: Mark-to-Market Profit in Stock Futures \\n93,75,000.00 \\nClosing Balance as on May 16, 2020 at 04:00 PM \\n3,91,30,300.00 \\n \\n• The Investment Manager of Fund INC was able to take suitable derivative positions, \\nboth in Stock LMN and in Gold. From the portfolio of Fund INC, only Stock LMN has \\ndecreased. This may have been done in order to hedge the market risk in Stock LMN. \\n \\n• It should be noted that NAV is not at the same level, as on opening hours of May 16, \\n2020. This is because the Investment Manager has taken an off-balance sheet \\nexposure133in derivative contracts, which reduces the balance maintained in F&O \\nMargin Account with the broker. \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n133 Off-Balance Sheet exposure refers to investing in assets which do not represent a direct obligation on the \\nfund, through leverage strategies and derivative contracts, although risks and returns associated with such \\nassets are indirectly borne by the fund. \\n269 | P a g e  \\n \\n8.2.3 Positions in Money Market Instruments and Long Term Fixed Income Securities \\nThe Money Market Instruments consist of instruments such as Treasury Bills (T-bills), \\nCertificates of Deposits (CDs), Commercial Papers (CPs), Bills of Exchange etc. with a short \\ntenor, i.e. not exceeding one year from date of issue. Within the one year, depending upon \\nthe tenors, money market is classified into: \\n• Overnight market - The tenor of transactions is one working day. \\n• Notice money market – The tenor of the transactions is from 2 days to 14 days. \\n• Term money market – The tenor of the transactions is from 15 days to one year. \\nCategory III AIFs invest in money market instruments and marketable securities, such as T-\\nbills in order to earn interest on its surplus investable funds that would be invested in \\nsecurities at a future date. Interest from money market securities may form a substantial part \\nof the interest income for the fund, on account of the high value of transactions executed by \\nsuch funds and other financial institutions like Banks, Mutual Funds, Insurance Companies \\nand Pension Funds.  \\n \\nA Category III AIF may invest in traded debt securities, or non-traded debt securities. A debt \\nsecurity is considered as a traded debt security when, on a specific Valuation Day, there are \\ntrades reported (in marketable lots) in that security on a recognised stock exchange or the \\nClearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL). \\n \\nMoney market instruments held by Category III AIFs are valued using Mark-to-Market \\nprocess, with the average of security level prices of such instruments disclosed by Financial \\nBenchmarks India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL), Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL), Fixed Income \\nMoney Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) and similar valuation agencies. \\nSimilarly, valuation of debt instruments for long-term fixed income securities, such as \\nGovernment Securities (G-Secs) and Corporate Bonds are done using the Mark-to-Market \\nprocess. The price of all G-Secs, with different maturities is published by the FBIL, CCIL and \\nFIMMDA. Closing prices of the Corporate Debt traded on a Recognized Stock Exchange is used \\nfor the purpose of computing the Fair Value of a Corporate Debt Security held by the Category \\nIII AIF. \\n \\nValuation of T-bills and G-Secs are done using the Volume Weighted Average Yield (VWAY) \\nfor trades in the last one hour of trading. Valuation of all other money market and debt \\nsecurities (including Government securities not traded in last one hour) are done on the basis \\nof VWAY of all trades during the day. Using the Mark-to-Market approach for valuation \\nreduces the potential default risk inherent in a fixed income security, due to a downgrade in \\nthe credit rating of a specific security. Instead of using “Amortized Cost” approach of \\nvaluation, mark-to-market method is more reliable and transparent, although it may reduce \\nthe discretion of managers in the valuation process of debt instruments. \\n \\n \\n \\n270 | P a g e  \\n \\n8.3 Computation of NAV for a Category III AIF vs. NAV attributable to a series of \\nunits issued to investors \\n \\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) for every unit of the Category III AIF is obtained by dividing the \\nvalue of the assets attributable to each class/sub-class of units, as reduced by liabilities, \\ncontingencies, losses and expenses attributable to such class/sub-class of units, by the total \\nnumber of units issued to the unit holders. NAV is rounded upto four decimal places.  \\nThe NAV per unit shall be calculated separately for each class of units or a Series of Units. \\nTotal Net Assets of the fund represents the total value attributable to all class of units and \\ninvestors with the Category III AIF. However, it is possible that all classes of units or investors \\nin the Fund may not derive the same Net Asset Value (NAV) for their respective units in the \\nfund. This may be possible on account of differential terms of subscription and fee structure \\noffered to a specific class of units or series of units, based on the quantum of capital \\ncommitments made by such investors and the time period when such capital commitments \\nare made. \\nThe Investment Manager of the Category III AIF allocates a unique number to each series of \\nunits, within a particular class of units, for the purpose of identification of differential rights \\noffered to such investors and calculation of their applicable “Series NAV”.  \\nSeries NAV is the NAV of each series of units within a particular class of units allotted to \\ninvestors and shall be equal to Series Assets, as reduced by the Series Liabilities and Series \\nExpenses, as on a Valuation Day and divided by the number of units issued under such Series. \\nSeries NAV is rounded upto four decimal places.  \\nThe terms Series Assets, Series Liabilities and Series Expenses are described as under: \\nSeries Assets:  \\nAssets of the Category III AIF which are attributable to a particular Series of units and shall be \\nallocated in the books of the Fund, to that specific Series of Beneficiaries or investors as assets \\nof that Series, as on the Valuation Day. Computation of Series Assets, as on a Valuation Day is \\ndone in the following manner: \\nSeries Assets = Total Assets of Fund     *    Opening Series NAV \\n \\n \\n      Total of all Opening Series NAV in Fund \\nThe Opening Series NAV is the Series NAV as on a Valuation Day, immediately prior to the \\ncurrent Valuation Day. On the issue of any new series of units, the Opening Series NAV for \\nsuch series of units on the first Valuation Day is equal to the amount drawn down against \\nissuance of units of such Series. NAV per unit of each Series of units, as on a Valuation Day, is \\ncomputed as its Series NAV divided by the number of units issued in such Series. \\n \\n \\n271 | P a g e  \\n \\nSeries Liabilities: \\nLiabilities and obligations of the Fund, outstanding as on the Valuation Day, are allocated \\namongst all Series of units in proportion to the Opening Series NAV. \\nSeries Expenses: \\nExpenses in relation to each Series shall generally comprise of fund expenses as determined \\nby the differential rights offered to the specific series of units, or Series Beneficiaries. \\n \\n• Management Fees (including goods and service tax thereon) and Incentive Fees \\nattributable to the specific series of units, as per the Contribution Agreement, shall be \\ncharged as Series Expenses. \\n \\n• Fund Expenses (including goods and service tax thereon) that are specifically \\nattributable to a series of units, shall be borne only by that Series of Beneficiaries, and \\nshall accordingly be allocated in the books of the Fund to that series of units. \\n \\n• Fund Expenses (including goods and service tax thereon) that are not specifically \\nattributable to a specific series of units shall generally be allocated amongst all the \\nseries and class of units, in proportion to the Opening Series NAV of each series issued \\nby the Fund. \\n \\nThe NAV per Unit of each series of units as of a Valuation Day (NAV per Unit) shall be the \\nSeries NAV of such series of units. Let us understand the calculation of Series NAV through \\nan example: \\nExample 6:  \\nFund SER has raised capital commitments worth Rs. 50 crore, by issuing the following Series \\nof Units to investors: \\n \\nClass of Units/ \\nSeries of Units \\nNo. of  \\nUnits \\nIssue Price \\n(Rs.) \\nCommitment \\n(Rs.) \\nClass A1 Units: Series A1001 – A1020  \\n2,00,000 \\n1000.00  \\n20,00,00,000  \\nClass A2 Units: Series A2001 – A2010  \\n1,00,000 \\n1000.00  \\n10,00,00,000 \\nClass B1 Units: Series B1001 – B1015 \\n1,50,000 \\n1000.00  \\n15,00,00,000  \\nClass C1 Units: Series C1001 – C1005 \\n50,000 \\n1000.00  \\n5,00,00,000 \\nTotal \\n5,00,000 \\n \\n50,00,00,000 \\n \\nClass C1 units are issued to the Sponsor of Fund SER, as minimum capital contribution of the \\nSponsor.

Likewise, the allocation percentage \\nfor all the other class of units has decreased minimally. This is primarily on account of \\nthe higher NAV per unit at the end of Year 1, for “Class A1 Units – Series A1001 – \\nA1020”. In the years a Category III AIF is increasing its Net Asset Value, it will be \\nbeneficial for Class A1 unit holders, as the NAV per unit for Class A1 unit holders will \\nincrease slightly more than the NAV for other unit holders in the fund. \\n \\n276 | P a g e  \\n \\nAs per recent SEBI Circular, no Category III AIF can adopt such a ‘priority distribution model’, \\nin which one class of investors are getting a higher share of profits, at the cost of another class \\nof investors.

The Investment Manager should ensure \\nthat the Category III AIF is within the prescribed Leverage Limits, specified by SEBI, based on \\nthe true and fair valuation of the Fund Assets and Liabilities.  \\nIn case the Category III AIF is dealing solely in listed securities, the price of such securities on \\nthe exchange platform shall be taken for the purpose of valuation. \\n \\nThe NAV of a Category III AIF shall be disclosed to all investors on quarterly basis, if the fund \\nis structured as a closed-ended Category III AIF and on monthly basis, if the fund is structured \\nas an open-ended Category III AIF.

Taxation of gains \\narising from investments is either paid by the investors in the fund, or by the AIF on behalf of \\nits investors, to avoid double taxation. “Tax pass-through” status of an entity means that the \\nAIF, under consideration, is not obliged to pay income tax on income generated by the AIF. \\nThe investors in such AIF are obliged to pay tax on income distributed by the fund to such \\ninvestors, while filing their respective income tax returns. Prior to introduction of Finance Act, \\n2015, most AIFs were set-up as a “Trust” in order to get the benefit of “tax pass-through”. \\nThis is because under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, an “Irrevocable Trust” whose beneficiaries \\nare ascertained, at the time of filing the Trust Deed, is eligible for a “tax pass-through”.  \\n \\nTo understand the tax-regime for Category III AIFs, it is important to understand the \\napplicability of following provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, as amended from time to time. \\n• Tax Pass-through Status of an AIF: \\nThe Finance Act, 2015 incorporated a tax-pass through status for an “Investment Fund”, \\nthrough Section 115UB of the Income Tax Act, 1961. As per Section 115UB, any income \\naccruing to, or received by a unit holder of an “Investment Fund” shall be considered as \\nincome accruing to, or received by, the unit-holder in the fund. \\nSection 115UB defines “Investment Funds” as follows: \\n“Investment Fund” means any fund established or incorporated in India in the form of a trust \\nor a company or a limited liability partnership or a body corporate which has been granted a \\ncertificate of registration as a Category I or a Category II Alternative Investment Fund and is \\n279 | P a g e  \\n \\nregulated under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Fund) \\nRegulations, 2012, made under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 or \\nregulated under the International Financial Services Centres Authority (Fund Management) \\nRegulations, 2022 made under the International Financial Services Authority Act, 2019;  \\nAs per the definition of “Investment Fund” mentioned in Section 115UB, Category III AIFs are \\nnot considered as Investment Funds and hence, not accorded the tax pass-through status. \\n• Nature of Taxable Income for the Investment Fund and Unit Holders in an AIF: \\nSection 115UB further provides that any income accruing to, or received by a unit holder of \\nan Investment Fund shall be chargeable to income-tax in the same manner as if it was income \\naccruing to, or received by, the unit-holder in the fund. \\nAs per Section 115UB, the nature of income streams in the hands of investment fund and in \\nthe hands of unit holders shall be considered identical. However, on account of Section \\n10(23FBA) and Section 10(23FBB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the nature of the income \\nstreams in the hands of investment fund and in the hands of unit holders is different.  \\no Section 10(23FBA) provides that income of the “Investment fund”, other than ‘profits \\nor gains from business or profession’, shall be exempt from taxation. Accordingly, \\nincome of the Investment Fund under the heads of ‘Capital Gains’ or ‘Income from \\nOther Sources’ is exempted from tax, at fund-level. \\no Section 10(23FBB) provides that income accrued to, or received by the unit holder, in \\nthe nature of ‘profits or gains from business or profession’ earned by the Investment \\nFund, is exempted from tax, in the hands of unit holders. \\nAfter consideration of Section 10(23FBA) and 10(23FBB), any income generated by the AIF, in \\nthe nature of ‘profits or gains from business or profession’ is taxable in the hands of \\nInvestment Fund. Any income accrued to, or received by, a unit holder in the AIF in the nature \\nof ‘Capital Gains’ or ‘Income from Other Sources’ shall be taxable at the applicable income \\ntax slab rates for the unit holder. \\n• Applicable Tax Rates for a Category III AIF: \\nSub-section (4) of section 115UB provides: \\no Where the Investment Fund is formed as a Company or a Limited Liability Partnership \\n(LLP), total income of such Investment Fund shall be charged to tax, as per the rates \\napplicable to Company or an LLP. \\no Where the Investment Fund is formed as a Trust, total income of such Investment \\nFund shall be charged to tax, at the Maximum Marginal Rate (MMR), currently at 30%.  \\n280 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Effective Tax Rate for a Category III AIF, considering Surcharge as well as Health and \\nEducation Cess: \\nThe surcharge applicable to income, other than Capital Gains under Section 111A and Section \\n112A, generated by domestic Individuals, Hindu Undivided Family (HUFs), Associations of \\nPersons (AoP) and Body of Individuals (BoI) is as follows:134  \\nIncome Slab \\nSurcharge Rate \\nTotal income exceeding Rs. 50 lakh but not exceeding Rs. 1 crore \\n10% \\nTotal income exceeding Rs. 1 crore but not exceeding Rs. 2 crore \\n15% \\nTotal income exceeding Rs. 2 crore but not exceeding Rs. 5 crore \\n25% \\nTotal income exceeding Rs. 5 crore \\n37% \\n \\nThe Surcharge is calculated on the tax liability of the assessee at these applicable rates. \\nFurther, Health and Education Cess at the rate of 4% is levied on aggregate of tax and \\nsurcharge. \\nAs a result of the increased surcharge, the effective tax rate for individuals and assessees \\nearning income of more than Rs. 2 crore, is as follows: \\nParticulars \\nApplicable \\nSurcharge and Cess \\nEffective Tax Rate \\nIncrease in Tax \\nRate \\nAnnual Income between \\nRs. 2 crore and Rs. 5 \\ncrore \\n25%  +  \\n4% Health & \\nEducation Cess \\n39.00% \\n3.12% \\nAnnual Income in excess \\nof Rs. 5 crore \\n37%  +  \\n4% Health & \\nEducation Cess \\n42.74% \\n6.86% \\n \\nThe surcharge applicable to income generated by domestic companies shall be as follows: \\nIncome Slab \\nSurcharge Rate \\nTotal income exceeds Rs. 1 crore but  \\ndoes not exceed Rs. 10 crore \\n7% \\n \\nTotal income exceeds Rs. 10 crore \\n12% \\n \\nThe Surcharge is calculated on the tax liability of the assessee at these applicable rates. \\nHowever, surcharge at flat rate of 10% shall be levied on base tax for the companies opting \\n                                                          \\n \\n134 Under new tax regime, the maximum surcharge is charged at 25% for total income exceeding Rs. 2 crore. \\n281 | P a g e  \\n \\nfor lower rate of tax of 22% or 15%.135 Further, Health and Education Cess at the rate of 4% is \\nlevied on aggregate of tax and surcharge. \\nCategory III AIFs categorizing their income as ‘Profits and Gains from Business or Profession’ \\nare also subject to surcharge rates, over and above the tax levied at Maximum Marginal Rate \\n(MMR). Due to the high tax rates, all the underlying unit holders investing in units of Category \\nIII AIFs indirectly bear the tax expense, unless some investors get the preferential tax \\ntreatment on account of ‘Most Favoured Nation’ (MFN) clauses in the Investor Side Letters \\nsigned with the Category III AIFs. \\n• Treatment of Losses: \\n \\nUnder Section 115UB of the Income Tax Act 1961, all investment funds registered as Category \\nI AIFs or Category II AIFs are treated as pass through entities and income earned by such AIFs, \\nother than business income, is taxed directly in the hands of unit holders.  \\nHowever, as per sub-section (2) of Section 115UB, losses incurred by the investment funds \\nare not passed on to the unit holders and hence, are carried forward or set off by the AIF in \\naccordance with Chapter VI of Income Tax Act. With the subsequent amendments made to \\nsub-section (2) of section 115UB, the treatment of losses incurred by the Investment Funds is \\nas follows: \\no Business losses of the Investment Fund shall be carried forward and set-off by the \\ninvestment fund, from taxable income. \\n \\no Losses, other than business losses, shall not be passed through to the unit holders, \\nif such losses arise in respect of units held by the unit holders for less than 12 \\nmonths.  \\n \\no Losses, other than business loss, accumulated at the level of investment fund as \\non 31st March, 2019, shall be deemed to be the loss of a unit holder who has held \\nunits in the fund as on 31st March, 2019, in respect of the investments made by \\nhim in the investment fund. Such unit holder shall be allowed to carry forward the \\nloss in his/her returns, until the expiry of 8 years from the year in which the loss \\nwas first incurred by the investment fund. This enables unit holders to utilize losses \\nwhich would have been retained at the investment fund level and probably not \\nbeen available for carry forward and set-off, in the hands of the investors. \\n \\no All losses deemed as losses in the hands of the unit holders shall not be available \\nto the investment fund for the purpose of set-off or carry-forward of losses in \\nfuture. \\n                                                          \\n \\n135These lower rates are subject to fulfilment of certain conditions as provided in Section 115BAA and Section \\n115BAB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 respectively. \\n282 | P a g e  \\n \\nThis tax-regime and Section 115UB of the Income tax Act, 1961, provides tax pass-through \\nonly to Category I AIF and Category II AIF. As the regime is not applicable to Category III AIFs, \\na bottleneck continues to exist for taxation-related issues. The income earned by a Category \\nIII AIF is taxed at the Maximum Marginal Rate (MMR), in the hands of the Fund, as tax pass-\\nthrough status is not accorded to Category III AIFs and most Category III AIFs are set-up as a \\n“Trust” structure. Tax-rates applicable to the Category III AIF are further determined by the \\nsource and nature of income, such as ‘Capital Gains’ or ‘Income from Other Sources’. \\n9.2 Taxation principles applicable to Trust structure \\nTax-regime for a Category III AIF depends on the legal structure of the entity. Most AIFs are \\nset-up as a “Trust” in order to get the benefit of “tax pass-through” and also due to the ability \\nto incorporate bespoke terms of governance for an AIF, as may be agreed between the \\nsponsor and the unit holders. The Indian Trusts Act, 1882 governs the creation and operation \\nof private trusts for the purpose of collecting and managing pools of capital. The Indian Trusts \\nAct is read in conjunction with relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, to determine \\nwhether a Trust qualifies for a ‘tax pass-through status’, for payment of income tax.  \\nA “Trust” is a legal entity set-up, for transfer of property from one person to another, with \\nthe intention that the Trust is administered for the benefit of the owners. The person who \\ntransfers the property is called a “Settlor”. The person to whom the property is transferred is \\ncalled the Trustee. The person for whose benefit the trust is created is called the \\n“beneficiary”. A Trust is created when the Settlor indicates his intention to create a trust. In \\norder to create a trust, the Settlor specifies the Trust Property, purpose of creating the Trust \\nand identifies the beneficiaries of the Trust. \\n9.2.1 Determinate Trust vs. Indeterminate Trust \\n \\nA “Determinate Trust” is a Trust wherein the trust beneficiaries, and their respective \\nbeneficial interests, are ascertainable as per the terms of the ‘Indenture of Trust\\' or the ‘Trust \\nDeed\\', at all times during its existence. An AIF set-up as a Trust will be considered as a \\nDeterminate Trust, if the unit holders along with their beneficial interest in the Fund, are \\nascertainable through the ‘Indenture of Trust\\' or the ‘Trust Deed\\' during the entire tenure of \\nthe fund.  \\nAn “Indeterminate Trust” is a Trust wherein the trust beneficiaries, and their respective \\nbeneficial interests, are not ascertainable as per the terms of the ‘Indenture of Trust\\' or the \\n‘Trust Deed\\'. Indeterminate Trusts can also be Discretionary Trusts, where the trustee \\nexercises discretion on utilisation of the assets of the trust, determines beneficial interest and \\nalso exercises discretion over the distribution of income of the Trust. However, Non-\\ndiscretionary Trusts are administered as per the clauses of the trust deed and are not driven \\non the discretion of the trustee. \\n283 | P a g e  \\n \\nIn order to ascertain whether a Trust is a “Determinate Trust” or not, the Income Tax \\nAppellate Tribunal has clarified that: \\no The beneficiaries as well as their beneficial interests must be capable of being \\nascertained on the date of the trust deed itself, without leaving these to be \\ndecided upon at future date, by a person other than the settlor. However, if the \\nTrust deed authorises addition of further contributors to the trust at different \\npoints of time, in addition to initial contributors, then the same would not make \\nthe beneficiaries unknown, or make their share indeterminate. \\n \\nTaxation Principles: If an AIF has been set up as a trust, the Trustee would be assessed as a \\n‘representative assessee’ under the provisions of Section 161 and Section 164 of the Income \\nTax Act, 1961.  \\nDeterminate Trusts: \\nAs per Section 161(1A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, if the income of the determinate trust \\nincludes income in the nature of ‘Profits or Gains from Business and Profession’, such income \\nshall be subject to tax at Maximum Marginal Rate of tax (MMR), payable by Trustee. As per \\nSection 161(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, if the Determinate Trust earns income other than \\nin the nature of ‘Profits or Gains from Business and Profession’, the Assessing Officer (AO) can \\npermit assessment of such income in the hands of the Trustee, wherein the Trustee would be \\nassessed as a ‘representative assessee’ of the fund. Hence, the Maximum Marginal Rate of \\ntax may not be applicable in this case, specifically on income from Capital Gains. This section \\nprovides that tax shall be levied upon and recovered from the Trustee, in the like manner and \\nto the same extent as it would be levied upon and recoverable from the beneficiaries of the \\nTrust, i.e. the unit holders in the fund. \\nOnce the income is taxed in the hands of the Trustee as a Representative Assessee, there will \\nbe no further income tax implications on subsequent distribution of the income by the trustee \\nin the hands of the beneficiaries. However, as per Section 166 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, \\nthe Assessing Officer may assess the income directly in the hands of beneficiaries, i.e. the unit \\nholders in the fund, provided the Trustee has not been taxed on such income. In such an \\nevent, any income tax paid by the Trustee in their capacity as a Representative Assessee \\nshould be in-principally available as credit against the income tax liability of the beneficiaries. \\nIndeterminate Trusts: \\nIn case of an Indeterminate Trust, the trust beneficiaries, along-with their beneficial interests, \\nare not specified in the Indenture of Trust. As per Section 164 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, \\nthe Trustee shall be assessed as a ‘representative assessee’ and pay income tax on income \\nearned by the fund at the Maximum Marginal Rate of tax (MMR). Since the beneficiaries are \\n284 | P a g e  \\n \\nnot known, the provisions of Section 166 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 will not be invoked and \\nhence, no income will be taxed in the hands of the unit holders. \\n \\n9.2.2 Revocable Trust vs. Irrevocable Trust \\nAn “Irrevocable Trust” is a Trust in which the Settlor of the Trust does not have powers to \\nrevoke the trust and the trust shall continue operations, until its purpose is served or \\nstipulated tenure is complete. An AIF is structured as an Irrevocable Trust, if the fund will not \\nbe revoked by the (a) consent of all the beneficiaries, (b) Settlor, in exercise of powers of \\nrevocation, expressly reserved for the Settlor. \\nA transfer of an asset is considered revocable when the contribution agreement contains a \\nprovision for: \\no the re-transfer, directly or indirectly, of the income earned from the asset to the \\ntransferor, or \\no giving a right to the transferor to reassume power, directly or indirectly, over the \\nwhole or any part of the income or asset. \\nA “Revocable Trust” is a Trust which can be revoked by the Settlor of such Trust, at their \\ndiscretion or as per the consent of the beneficiaries. An AIF, structured as a Revocable Trust, \\nmay be revoked at any time before the completion of fund tenure. As long as power to revoke \\nexists with the Settlor of the Trust, the manner of revocation is not taken in to consideration \\nto ascertain the tax liability of the Trust. Hence, partial revocation is also acceptable as a \\npower to revoke, and considered as a “Revocable Trust”. \\n \\nTaxation Principles: As per Section 61 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, in case of a revocable \\ntransfer of assets, all income arising by virtue of such revocable transfer shall be chargeable \\nto tax as the income of the transferor and shall be included in total income of the transferor. \\nHence, if an AIF is set-up as a revocable trust and makes a revocable transfer of assets, income \\naccruing to the fund on account of such transfer will not be eligible for a tax pass-through.  \\nIn case of an irrevocable transfer, the tax treatment will be determined on the basis of \\nwhether the respective shares of the beneficiaries in the Trust are determinate or not.  \\nFigure 9.1 summarizes the tax treatment of Determinate Trusts and Indeterminate Trusts, \\nwhether structured as a Revocable Trust or Irrevocable Trust: \\n \\n \\n285 | P a g e  \\n \\nFigure 9.1: Tax pass-through status of AIF set-up as a “Determinate” and “Irrevocable” Trust \\n \\n \\n9.3 Tax applicability on income from Category III AIFs \\n \\nAs seen from the direct taxation regime discussed above, taxation on income earned by a \\nCategory III AIF is dependent on the stream of income, as defined under the relevant \\nprovisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. If an AIF is structured as an ‘Irrevocable Determinate \\nTrust’, income earned under the head ‘Profits or Gains from business and profession’ is \\ntaxable at the Maximum Marginal Rate (MMR). All other sources of income, including income \\nfrom ‘Capital Gains’ and ‘Income from Other Sources’ are eligible for a tax pass-through, \\nwherein the beneficiaries in the trust are taxed at the applicable income tax rate on such \\nincome, for the relevant financial year. \\nThe unit holders in a Category III AIF would primarily earn income from the following streams:  \\n \\n• Interest income \\n• Dividend income \\n• Gains on transfer of listed shares or mutual fund units \\n• Gains on transfer of listed and unlisted bonds or debentures \\n• Gains arising from transaction in derivatives such as futures and options \\n• Gains on transfer of units of the Fund \\n \\nThe tax applicability on all these streams of income is discussed below: \\n \\n \\nTax Regime\\nIncome Source\\nIrrevocability\\nDeterminacy\\nFund Structure\\nAIF as a \\n“Trust”\\nDeterminate \\nTrust\\nRevocable \\nTrust\\nGross Total \\nIncome\\nNo Tax \\nPass-\\nthrough\\nIrrevocabl\\ne Trust\\nIncome from \\nBusiness & \\nProfession\\nTaxable at \\nMMR\\nIncome other \\nthan Business \\nIncome\\nTax Pass-\\nthrough\\nIndeterminate \\nTrust\\nTaxable at \\nMMR\\n286 | P a g e  \\n \\n9.3.1 Taxation of Interest income  \\nInterest income accrues to the Category III AIF on debt investments made in the investee \\ncompanies, through debentures and bonds. The interest income is subject to tax in the hands \\nof all unit holders, as per the rate of income tax applicable to every unit holder investing in \\nthe fund. \\n9.3.2 Taxation of Dividend income \\nThe Finance Act, 2020 has withdrawn the Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) under section 115-\\nO, liable to be paid by domestic companies on dividends declared out of accumulated profits. \\nFinancial Year 2020-2021 onwards, section 10(34) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has also been \\nwithdrawn, which exempts dividends received by investors from a domestic company from \\nincome tax. Thus, if dividend is distributed on or after April 1, 2020, the domestic companies \\nshall not be liable to pay DDT and, consequently, the investors shall be liable to pay tax on \\nsuch dividend income. \\nA Category III AIF would now be liable to pay tax on Dividend Income received from domestic \\ncompanies in India. If the fund treats its investment in the shares of a domestic company as \\n‘stock-in-trade’ or is held for trading purposes, any dividend income received thereon would \\nbe taxed as ‘Profits or Gains from Business or Profession’. In this case, the fund can claim a \\ndeduction of all such expenditures incurred to earn the dividend income, including collection \\ncharges and interest on loan taken. However, if the fund treats such shares in the domestic \\ncompany as ‘investments’, any dividend income received thereon would be taxed as ‘Income \\nfrom Other Sources’, and tax thereon would be paid by the fund as a representative assessee \\nif the Category III AIF is structured as an ‘Irrevocable Determinate Trust’. In this case, the fund \\ncan claim a deduction of only interest expenditure incurred to earn the dividend income, to \\nthe extent of 20% of the total dividend income. No other deduction is allowed for any other \\nexpense, such as commission or remuneration paid to a banker. \\nAs per Section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, an Indian company shall deduct tax at the \\nrate of 10% from dividend distributed and paid, on or after April 1, 2020, to resident \\nshareholders such as Category III AIFs. Section 194 shall be applicable if the aggregate amount \\nof dividend distributed or paid during the financial year to the Category III AIF exceeds Rs. \\n5,000. \\n9.3.3 Taxation of Capital Gains on Listed and Unlisted Securities \\nAs per Section 45 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, any profits or gains arising from the transfer \\nof capital assets are chargeable to income tax under the head ‘Capital Gains’. Section 48 of \\nthe Income Tax Act, 1961 provides that income chargeable as capital gains would be \\ncomputed as follows: \\nFull Value of Consideration:  \\nXXX \\nLess: Cost of Acquisition/Indexed Cost of Acquisition \\n(XXX) \\nLess: Cost of Improvement incurred in relation to the asset transferred \\n(XXX) \\nLess: Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in  \\nconnection with the transfer of the asset \\n(XXX) \\nLong Term Capital Gain / Short Term Capital Gain:  \\nXXX \\n \\nThe following table 9.1 summarizes the applicable tax rates, for F.Y. 2021-2022 on “Capital \\nGains” for a Category III AIF: \\n287 | P a g e  \\n \\nTable9.1:  Tax Rates Applicable on Capital Gains \\nParticulars \\nIncome Head – Capital Gains \\nShort-term Capital \\nGain 1 \\nLong-term Capital Gain 1 \\nListed equity shares and \\nunits of equity-oriented \\nscheme \\n15% \\n(where STT2 is paid) \\n10% on amount in excess of Rs. \\n1 lakh \\n(where STT is paid and amount \\nof capital gain exceeds Rs. 1 \\nlakh in a financial year) \\nListed bonds and \\ndebentures \\nAt tax slab rates of the \\nindividual (i.e. 30% if \\nin highest tax slab) \\n10% (without indexation) \\nOR \\n20% (with indexation) \\nUnlisted bonds and \\ndebentures \\n30% \\n20% \\nUnits of a non-equity \\noriented scheme \\nAt tax slab rates of the \\nindividual (i.e. 30% if \\nin highest tax slab) \\nAt tax slab rates of the \\nindividual (w.e.f. April 1, \\n2023) \\nUnlisted equity shares \\n30% \\n20% (with indexation) \\n1Tax on Short-term Capital Gain and Long-term Capital Gain is excluding applicable Surcharge \\nand Health and Education Cess. \\n2STT – Securities Transaction Tax is applicable on equity shares, derivatives and units of \\nequity-oriented mutual funds. \\n \\n• Applicable STT Rates: \\no Delivery-based purchase and sale of equity shares, traded on a recognized stock \\nexchange in India, are subject to STT at the rate of 0.1% on the transaction value \\nof such purchase or sale.  \\no No STT is applicable on purchase of units of equity-oriented mutual funds. \\nHowever, STT at the rate of 0.001% is levied on the delivery-based sale of units of \\nequity-oriented mutual funds, traded on a recognized stock exchange in India. \\no STT is levied on the seller at the rate of 0.0625% on the sale of option in securities. \\nHowever, STT is levied on the purchaser at the rate of 0.125% on sale of option in \\nsecurities, where the option is exercised. STT is levied on the seller at the rate of \\n0.0125% on the sale of futures in securities. \\no STT is levied on the seller at the rate of 0.025% on the sale of equity shares in a \\ncompany or units of business trust or units of an equity oriented mutual fund, \\nsettled otherwise than by actual delivery and transaction on a recognized Stock \\nExchange in India. \\no STT at the rate of 0.2% on the transaction value is levied on sale of unlisted equity \\nshares and units of business trust under an initial public offer.  \\n288 | P a g e  \\n \\nUnder Section 2(42A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ‘short-term capital asset’ is a capital asset \\nheld by the assessee, for a period not more than: \\no 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer, in case of securities listed \\non a recognized stock exchange, a unit of an equity oriented fund, listed bonds and \\ndebentures, or a zero coupon bond. \\no 24 months, immediately preceding the date of transfer, in case of shares held of \\ncompany not being listed on a recognized stock exchange. \\no 36 months, immediately preceding the date of transfer, in case of debentures held \\nof company not being listed on a recognized stock exchange of units of a non-\\nequity-oriented fund. \\nSection 112A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was introduced by Finance Act 2018, to tax long-\\nterm capital gains arising from the sale of listed equity shares, units of equity-oriented mutual \\nfunds and units of business trust. As per Section 112A(2), if the long-term capital gains on \\ntransfer of listed equity shares, units of an equity-oriented mutual fund or units of a business \\ntrust exceed Rs. 1 lakh, then the amount in excess of Rs. 1 lakh is taxable at a rate of 10%. The \\nsurcharge applicable is 15% and Health & Education Cess applicable is 4%. A Category III AIF \\nwill be liable to pay tax as per the provisions of Section 112A, provided: \\no There is a sale of listed equity shares, units of an equity-oriented mutual fund or \\nunits of a business trust, which are held for a period of more than 12 months from \\nthe date of purchase. \\no The fund has paid the applicable Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on the purchase \\nand sale of equity shares. In case of equity-oriented mutual fund units or business \\ntrust, the fund has paid the applicable STT on the sale of units. \\nSection 111A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is applicable on short-term capital gains arising \\nfrom the sale of listed equity shares, units of equity-oriented mutual funds and units of \\nbusiness trust. Short-term Capital Gains under Section 111A are taxed at 15%, the surcharge \\napplicable is 15% and Health & Education Cess applicable is 4%. A Category III AIF can take \\nthe benefit of such concessional tax rates in the following circumstances: \\no Short-term Capital Gains earned on sale of equity shares listed on a recognised \\nstock exchange, chargeable to STT. \\no Short-term Capital Gains earned on sale of units of an equity oriented mutual fund \\nor units of a business trust sold through a recognised stock exchange, chargeable \\nto STT. \\no Short-term Capital Gains earned on sale of equity shares, units of equity oriented \\nmutual funds or units of a business trust through a recognised stock exchange \\nlocated in IFSC and consideration is paid or payable in foreign currency. Such a sale \\ntransaction is eligible for the concessional rate under section 111A even if STT is \\nnot paid on such transaction. \\n289 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe concessional tax rates applicable on income from Capital Gains should gain precedence \\nover the maximum marginal rate under Section 164 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, \\nthe Income Tax authorities have a right to take a contrary view and charge such income at the \\nmaximum marginal rate. \\nDue to the nature of business carried out by a Category III AIF, there have been disputes on \\nwhether income earned by the fund, from the sale of shares and securities held by the fund, \\nshould be treated as income under ‘Capital Gains’ or income under ‘Profits and Gains from \\nBusiness and Profession’. Disputes are also on account of the difference in the tax rates \\npayable by Category III AIFs, on the income earned under ‘Profits and Gains from Business \\nand Profession’ and income earned under ‘Capital Gains’. \\nIn the securities markets and through investment strategies adopted by Indian Category III \\nAIFs, a majority of transactions take place in respect of listed shares and securities. In order \\nto reduce litigation and to maintain consistency in approach on the issue of treatment of \\nincome derived from transfer of listed shares and securities, the Central Board of Direct Taxes \\n(CBDT) has issued a circular that aims to provide consistency in the taxability of the income \\ngenerated by a Category III AIF, on account of transfer of listed shares and securities.136 The \\nCBDT has instructed the Assessing Officers (AO) to consider the following principles for \\ntreatment of income derived from transfer of listed shares and securities, as either capital \\ngain or business income: \\no If the Category III AIF opts to treat listed shares and securities as stock-in-trade, \\nthen irrespective of the period of holding of such securities, any income arising \\nfrom transfer of such shares and securities would be treated as income under \\n‘Profits and Gains from Business and Profession’. \\no In respect of listed shares and securities held for a period of more than 12 months, \\nimmediately preceding the date of transfer, if the Category III AIF opts to treat \\nincome arising from such transfer as ‘Capital Gains’, the same shall not be put to \\ndispute by the Assessing Officer. However, once this option is taken by the \\nCategory III AIF in a particular assessment year, the fund shall be bound to treat all \\nsuch income, in subsequent assessment years, as income under ‘Capital Gains’. \\no Such option given to Category III AIFs and above principles for categorization will \\nnot apply for those transactions, where there is a question on the genuineness of \\nthe transaction, such as bogus claims of long-term capital gain, short-term capital \\nloss or any other sham transactions. \\no Gains arising on buy back of shares listed on a recognized stock exchange should \\nbe taxed in the similar manner as the gains on sale of listed shares and securities. \\nSimilarly, to have a consistent view in assessment and to avoid disputes pertaining to income \\narising from transfer of unlisted shares and securities, by a Category III AIF, the CBDT has \\n                                                          \\n \\n136Vide CBDT Circular No.: 6/2016 dated February 29, 2016. \\n290 | P a g e  \\n \\nfurther clarified that the income arising from transfer of unlisted shares would be considered \\nunder the head ‘Capital Gains’ irrespective of holding.137 Such assumption would however not \\napply to situations where: \\no the genuineness of the sale of unlisted shares is questionable; or \\no the transfer is related to an issue pertaining to lifting of corporate veil; or \\no the transfer of unlisted shares is made along with the control and management of \\nthe underlying business. \\nThe Assessing Officer in the aforesaid cases will take a view depending on the facts and \\ncircumstances of each case. \\n \\nIt is to be noted that the aforesaid circulars issued by CBDT provide the required clarity in \\nrespect of capital gains arising from listed shares and unlisted shares. However, there is still a \\nclarification required from treatment of gains arising from sale of following securities:  \\no Sale of listed investments held for less than 12 months;   \\no Sale of unlisted securities, other than shares;  \\no Income arising from debt investments to an AIF that makes investments in debt \\nsecurities \\n9.3.4 Taxation of Gains arising from Transactions in Derivative Contracts such as Futures \\nand Options: \\nCategory III AIFs take exposure in futures and options contracts, for the purpose of hedging \\nor taking additional leverage. Any gains arising from these transactions shall be treated as \\n‘Profits and Gains from Business and Profession’ and the fund should be liable to pay tax on \\nsuch income at the Maximum Marginal Rate of Tax, i.e. 42.744%. \\n9.3.5 Taxation of Deemed Income on Investment in Shares and Securities in India: \\nCategory III AIFs may acquire shares of an Investee Company, for a consideration lower than \\nthe Fair Market Value (FMV) of such shares. As per Section 56(2)(x) of the Income Tax Act, \\n1961, if the Category III AIF acquires any shares or securities for a consideration below the \\nFair Market Value of such shares or securities, then the difference between the consideration \\npaid and the Fair Market Value shall be taxable in the hands of the Category III AIF, as ‘Income \\nfrom Other Sources’.  \\nLet us understand the taxation of different sources of income of a Category III AIF: \\n \\nExample 1: Fund TI \\n \\nFund TI was launched in the year 2018, as an Irrevocable, Determinate Trust, with an aim to \\nprimarily make equity investments and debt investments only: \\n \\n                                                          \\n \\n137Vide CBDT Letter No.:F.No.225/12/2016/ITA.II dated May 2, 2016. \\n291 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount \\nCommitted Capital (Rs.) \\n60,00,00,000 \\nNo. of units issued \\n6,00,000  \\nNAV (Rs.) \\n1000.00  \\n \\nFund TI made the following investments on April 01, 2018: \\n \\nParticulars \\nQuantity  \\nRate \\nAmount (Rs.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nListed Equities: \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany ABC \\n50,000  \\n825.00 \\n4,12,50,000.00  \\nCompany XYZ \\n1,00,000  \\n1,175.00 \\n11,75,00,000.00  \\nCompany PQC \\n10,00,000  \\n145.00 \\n14,50,00,000.00  \\nCompany LMN \\n75,000  \\n2,250.00 \\n16,87,50,000.00  \\n \\n \\n \\n47,25,00,000.00 \\nUnlisted Equities: \\n \\n \\n \\nCompany SME \\n1,50,000  \\n115.00 \\n1,72,50,000.00  \\nCompany AEC \\n10,00,000  \\n105.00 \\n10,50,00,000.00  \\n \\n \\n \\n12,22,50,000.00 \\n \\nThe Fund liquidates the holdings after three years, ending on March 31, 2021.

The surcharge applicable is 15% and Health and \\nEducation Cess is levied at the rate of 4% on the amount of income-tax plus surcharge. \\no Surcharge applicable on Dividend Income will be at 25%, as the income of Fund TI, \\nexcluding Capital Gains under sections 112A and 111A, is above Rs. 2 crore and less \\nthan Rs. 5 crore. \\n \\no It can be observed that Fund TI has sold its investment in Company AEC and Company \\nSME after serving a six-month lock-in period applicable under the provisions of SEBI \\n(Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018.  \\n \\no On a deeper analysis, we can conclude that Incentive Fees will not be payable to the \\nInvestment Manager, even if a miniscule hurdle rate of 8% is applied to the Net AUM \\nof the fund, after deducting the fixed expenses and management fees. This is \\n299 | P a g e  \\n \\nirrespective of the income being treated as ‘Profits and Gains from Business or \\nProfession’ or ‘Capital Gains’. \\n \\n9.4 Goods and Services Tax  \\n \\nA Category III AIF investment manager charges Management Fees, in return of the Investment \\nManagement services offered to the unit holders in the Fund. Such services fall under the \\ndefinition of “Supply”, as per Section 7 of the CGST Act, 2017, as “Investment Advisory & \\nManagement Services”.138 Goods and Services Tax (GST) is payable at the rate of 18% on such \\nfees.  \\n \\nGST is also levied on the Trusteeship Fees, payable to the Trustee of the Category III AIF, at \\nthe rate of 18%. Further, GST is also chargeable on services provided by external service \\nproviders, such as Fund Administrators, Registrars, Custodians, Auditors, Brokers, Investment \\nAdvisors and other third-party professional experts. The services provided by such external \\nservice providers are taxable as “Financial and related Services”, at the rate of 18%. \\n \\nGST is payable by the Category III AIF and is eligible to receive input credits for the GST paid, \\non its output GST Liability. However, considering the nature of business of a Category III AIF \\nas a pooled investment vehicle, the fund has no output GST liability and, therefore, unable to \\nobtain any benefit of input tax credits for GST paid on Management Fees, Trusteeship Fees \\nand other input services availed by the fund. This results in an incremental cost for the \\nCategory III AIF, which is indirectly borne by the investors. \\n \\nCategory III AIFs operating from IFSC are exempt from GST, which enables them to offer a \\ncompetent investment platform to foreign portfolio investors, similar to other popular off-\\nshore destinations. \\n \\nUnder the current GST regime, a Category III AIF that pools capital from foreign investors at \\nan offshore location, in order to invest in India, does not pay GST on the management fees. \\nManagement Fees charged by such off-shore Category III AIFs are treated as “export of \\nservices”, which is exempt from GST. However, in case of Category III AIFs, domiciled in India \\nand pooling capital from overseas investors, GST on management fees is payable. For foreign \\ninvestors in such Category III AIFs, this also violates the principle of destination-based \\nconsumption tax. As a result, foreign investors willing to invest in Indian markets through the \\nAIF route would prefer to invest in an offshore Category III AIF or a ‘hedge fund’, on account \\nof lower tax liabilities of the fund set-up in offshore jurisdictions.  \\n \\nOn account of such inconsistency in the GST liabilities of Category III AIFs domiciled in India \\nand off-shore AIFs, the Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee (AIPAC) formed by \\nSEBI, has provided the following recommendations to enhance pooling of funds in Indian AIFs: \\no AIFs which have a 100% foreign investment, excluding the domestic sponsor \\ncommitments, and locating their fund management operations in India should be \\n                                                          \\n \\n138These services are classified under Heading 997153 as per Notification 11/2017 – CGST (Rate), dated \\nJune 28, 2017. \\n300 | P a g e  \\n \\nexempt from GST. Services provided by the investment manager are completely \\nconsumed outside India, thus qualifying as ‘export of services’. \\no AIFs that have at least 50% foreign investments can qualify for a zero rate of GST \\nor a lower rate of GST, such as 5%. This can encourage investment managers to \\nset-up an AIF in India and promote on-shoring of funds.  \\nManagement Fees and fixed fees payable by the Category III AIF are subject to GST. However, \\nthe present GST regime is silent on the chargeability of GST on the ‘Additional Returns’ or \\n‘Preferred Returns’ accrued to the Fund. A Category III AIF is liable to pay Performance Fees \\non such returns to the Investment Manager. Performance Fees are payable as a compensation \\nfor additional returns generated by the investment manager and not in return for any service \\nprovided by the investment manager. Hence, such Additional Returns should be taxed as long-\\nterm capital gains accrued to the Category III AIF, as they are a reward for taking the market \\nrisks. In the case of a partnership firm or Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), the levy of GST is \\nnot attracted on distributions of profits by such firm, or LLP, to its partners. Globally as well, \\ndistribution of profits by partnership firm, or LLP, to its partners is outside the purview of GST. \\n \\nSection 89(1) of the CGST Act casts a joint and several liability on all directors of a private \\nlimited company which defaults in payment of GST, including interest or penalty thereon. \\nSuch liability is however not triggered, if the director proves that the non-recovery of taxes, \\ninterest or penalty cannot be attributed to any gross negligence, misfeasance or breach of \\nduty of the director.  \\n \\n9.5 Taxation on distribution/ redemption of units by Category III AIFs \\n \\nA Category III AIF, through its Trustee, shall discharge its tax liabilities in respect of the income \\nearned by the Fund, in the capacity of a ‘representative assessee’ of the unit holders or \\ninvestors or beneficiaries in the Fund. Once the tax liabilities have been discharged by the \\nTrustee of the fund, no further tax is payable by the unit holders, on the post-tax income \\ndistributions. This avoids double taxation of the same source of income earned by the fund. \\nHowever, any early redemption of units of the Category III AIF, by a unit holder, may be \\ntreated as a separate taxable transfer. In such an event, the redeeming unit holder may be \\nsubject to tax on such redemption in addition to the tax liability discharged by the Category \\nIII AIF. \\nAs per Section 94(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, if an investor sells or transfers the units of \\na Category III AIF and reacquires the same units after a period of time, then any interest, \\ndividend or other such apportioned income attributable to such units would be deemed to \\nbe the income of the investor. \\nCorporate beneficiaries are subject to the provisions of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) \\ncontained in Section 115JB of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Hence, corporate beneficiaries may \\nbe liable to pay an additional tax on the distributions received from a Category III AIF, if the \\ntax amount calculated at the rate of 18.5% (plus applicable surcharge and health and \\neducation cess) of the book profits is higher than the tax amount calculated as per the Income \\nTax Act, 1961.  \\n301 | P a g e  \\n \\nA Category III AIF is liable to deduct ‘tax deducted at source’ (TDS) on distributions made to \\nits unit holders, as per provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The unit holders can claim \\nrefund of such TDS deductions from their taxable income, in their income tax return. Any \\ndistribution of income made by an AIF, other than distribution of income in the nature of \\n‘Profits or Gains from Business or Profession’ is subject to withholding tax requirements, \\nunder section 194LBB of the Income Tax Act, 1961. An AIF is liable to deduct at the rate of:  \\n \\no 10%, at the time of credit or at the time of payment of such income, whichever is \\nearlier, to the account of a ‘resident investor’ or a ‘domestic company’. \\no 20%, at the time of credit of such income to the account of a resident investor who \\ndoes not quote a Permanent Account Number (PAN) to the fund. \\no 30%, at the time of credit or at the time of payment of such income, whichever is \\nearlier, to the account of a ‘non-resident investor’. This amount shall be increased \\nby the applicable Surcharge for such investor, along-with 4% Health and Education \\nCess. \\no 40%, at the time of credit or at the time of payment of such income, whichever is \\nearlier, to the account of a ‘foreign company’. This amount shall be increased by \\nthe applicable Surcharge for such investor, along-with 4% Health and Education \\nCess. \\n \\nAs per Section 195(3), a non-resident investor can make an application to the Assessing \\nOfficer, for the grant of a certificate which authorizes such investor to receive income from \\nthe AIF, without deduction of withholding taxes or deduction at a lower rate. Alternatively, a \\nnon-resident investor can submit a Certificate issued by a Chartered Accountant, which \\ndetermines the chargeability of withholding tax, on income earned by the non-resident \\ninvestor. Upon submission of above Certificate(s) by the non-resident investor, the AIF is \\nresponsible to make payments to the non-resident investor, without deducting tax or \\ndeducting tax at a lower rate as stated in the Certificate. \\n \\nExample 2: Withholding Taxes \\n \\nFund WT was launched in the year 2016, as an Irrevocable, Determinate Trust, with an aim to \\nprimarily make equity investments and debt investments: \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount \\nCommitted Capital \\nRs. 60,00,00,000 \\nNo. of units issued \\n6,00,000  \\nNAV (Rs.) \\n1000.00  \\n \\nThe following table provides details of income and expenses for Fund WT, during the years. \\n \\nParticulars \\nF.Y. 2018-2019 \\nF.Y. 2019-2020 \\nF.Y. 2020-2021 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDividend Income \\n3,50,00,000  \\n3,80,00,000  \\n3,95,00,000  \\nInterest Income \\n1,95,00,000  \\n      1,95,00,000  \\n1,95,00,000  \\n302 | P a g e  \\n \\nManagement Fees @ 2%  \\n(including GST) \\n     1,53,80,000  \\n    1,59,35,000  \\n                    \\n1,65,20,000  \\nFixed Yearly Expenses \\n25,00,000  \\n25,00,000 \\n25,00,000 \\n \\nDistribution of interest income from debentures is made on a yearly basis to the investors.  \\n \\nThe NAV of the fund, at the end of financial year 2020-2021 is Rs.1195.00 and investors \\nredeem all the units, as on March 31, 2021. \\n \\nCompute the tax deducted by Fund WT, on distributions made in all three financial years. \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nAny distribution of income made by a Category III AIF, other than distribution of income in \\nthe nature of ‘Profits or Gains from Business or Profession’ is subject to withholding tax \\nrequirements, under section 194LBB.

It is assumed that Dividend Income and Appreciation in the value of \\nInvestments is reinvested in the Fund and not credited to the account of the investors. \\nThis may be done prudently by the investment manager in order to make payment of \\nyearly fixed expenses like management fees and fixed yearly expenses, as well as to \\nre-invest funds based on the investment strategy of the fund. \\n \\n \\n \\n303 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Applicability of Tax on Distributed Profits of Domestic Companies \\n \\nFinance Act, 2020 has withdrawn Section 115-O of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Hence, from \\nApril 1, 2020, domestic companies are not liable to pay Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) on \\ndividends declared out of accumulated profits. A Category III AIF receiving dividend from a \\ndomestic company shall be liable to pay tax on such dividend income, either as ‘Profits and \\nGains from Business or Profession’ or as ‘Income from Other Sources’. \\n \\nSimilarly, dividends distributed by a Company, having units set-up in an IFSC, is not liable to \\npay DDT on dividends declared out of accumulated profits or current profits. \\n \\n• Applicability of General Anti-Avoidance Rule  \\n \\nGeneral Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) is an anti-tax avoidance law, introduced in Chapter X-A \\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961. GAAR may be invoked by the Indian income-tax authorities, in \\ncase any arrangements entered into by a Category III AIF are found to be impermissible \\navoidance arrangements. Provisions under this section are applicable from financial year \\n2017-2018 and will not be applicable to income accruing, arising or received from transfer of \\ninvestments made before April 1, 2017. \\n \\nA transaction can be declared as an impermissible avoidance arrangement, if the main \\npurpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit and which satisfies one of the four tests \\nmentioned below: \\n \\no The transaction provides rights or obligations which are ordinarily not created \\nbetween parties dealing at arm\\'s length; \\no The transaction results in direct or indirect misuse, or abuse, of Income Tax Act; \\no The transaction lacks commercial substance or is deemed to lack commercial \\nsubstance in whole or in part; \\no The transaction is entered into, or carried out in a manner, which is not normally \\nemployed for bona fide business purposes. \\n \\nIn such cases, tax authorities are empowered to reallocate the income from such \\narrangement or re- characterise or disregard the arrangement, in the following manner: \\no Dis-regarding, combining or re-characterising any step or party to transaction; \\no Ignoring the arrangement for the purpose of taxation law; \\no Deeming connected persons, in relation to each other, to be one person for the \\npurposes of determining tax treatment of any amount \\no Relocating place of residence of a party, or location of a transaction or site of an \\nasset, to a place other than provided in the arrangement; \\no Looking through the arrangement by disregarding any corporate structure; or \\no Re-characterising equity into debt or capital into revenue \\n \\nIn case the GAAR provisions are invoked, then any treaty benefits under a Double Tax \\nAvoidance Agreement (DTAA) could be denied. This could result in any tax benefit being \\n304 | P a g e  \\n \\ndenied, shifting of residency of investors or re-characterization of capital gains income as any \\nother classification. \\n \\nThe CBDT has clarified that GAAR will not interplay with the right of a taxpayer to select or \\nchoose the method of implementing a transaction. Further, CBDT has issued clarifications on \\nimplementation of GAAR provisions, as under:139 \\n \\no GAAR shall not be invoked merely on the ground that an entity is located in a tax \\nefficient jurisdiction.  \\no GAAR shall not be invoked in case tax avoidance is sufficiently addressed by the \\nLimitation of Benefit Clause (LOB) in a Treaty with other countries.  \\n \\n9.6 Taxation on transfer of Category III AIF units by investors \\n \\nThe process for transfer of units should be clearly stated by a Category III AIF in the Private \\nPlacement Memorandum (PPM) to provide a mechanism for investors to transfer units before \\nthe end of the Fund’s life. Gains arising on account of a transfer of units of the fund, from one \\ninvestor to another, are subject to income tax in the hands of the investor initiating such \\ntransfer.  \\n \\nSection 45 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, provides that any profits or gains arising from the \\ntransfer of a ‘Capital Asset’ will be chargeable to income-tax under the head ‘Capital Gains’. \\nFor our purpose of understanding taxation on transfer of units of a Category III AIF: \\n \\n‘Transfer’ as per Section 2(47), includes ‘sale’ or ‘exchange’ of a capital asset. \\n \\n‘Capital Asset’ as per section 2(14), includes units of an ‘equity-oriented investment fund’ or \\nunits of funds listed on a recognized stock exchange.  \\n \\n‘Equity-oriented investment fund’ as per Chapter 97 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, means a \\nfund which has been set-up under a scheme of a Mutual Fund and at least 65 percent of the \\ntotal proceeds of the fund are invested in equity shares of domestic companies. Percentage \\nof equity shareholding of the fund shall be computed with reference to the annual average of \\nthe monthly averages of the opening and closing NAV of the Fund. \\n \\nHowever, the definition of ‘Capital Asset’, as per the Income Tax Act, 1961, does not include \\n‘Category III AIFs’, for the purpose of computing the profits or gains arising from the transfer \\nof units of such funds. With a view to bring clarity and compute Capital Gains on transfer of \\nunits of a Category III AIF, the SEBI AIPAC recommended the following addition to the \\ndefinition of an equity-oriented investment fund. \\n \\n‘Equity-oriented investment fund’ means an investment fund, which has been granted a \\ncertificate of registration as a Category III Alternative Investment Fund and is regulated under \\nthe SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. \\n                                                          \\n \\n139Vide CBDT Circular No. 7 of 2017 dated January 27, 2017. \\n305 | P a g e  \\n \\no in case a Category III AIF invests in units of another fund, traded on a recognized stock \\nexchange in India: \\n▪ a minimum of 90 percent of total proceeds of the Category III AIF is invested in the \\nunits of such other fund; and \\n▪ investee fund(s) also invest a minimum of 90 percent of its total proceeds in equity \\nshares of domestic companies, listed on a recognized stock exchange in India;  \\no in any other case, investable funds are invested in equity shares of domestic \\ncompanies listed on a recognized stock exchange in India to the extent of more than \\n65 percent of the total proceeds of such fund.  \\n \\nPercentage of equity shareholding of the Category III AIF shall be computed with \\nreference to the annual average of the monthly averages of the opening and closing NAV \\nof the Fund. \\n \\nThe Income Tax Act, 1961 provides for a mechanism for computation of income under the \\n‘capital gains’ head. Capital gains or losses are to be computed in the following manner: \\n \\nFull Value of Consideration:  \\nXXX \\nLess: Cost of Acquisition  \\n(XXX) \\nLess: Cost of Improvement incurred in relation to the asset transferred \\n(XXX) \\nLess: Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with the \\ntransfer of the asset. \\n(XXX) \\nLong Term Capital Gain / Short Term Capital Gain:  \\nXXX \\n \\nThe rate at which capital gain tax is charged depends on the nature of the Category III AIF and \\nthe types of investments made by such fund. If the Category III AIF is classified as an ‘equity-\\noriented investment fund’, then any profits arising from transfer of units of such fund are \\ntaxable at the rate of 15% in case of short-term capital gains, and 10% in case of long-term \\ncapital gains. Similarly, if the Category III AIF is classified as a ‘non equity-oriented investment \\nfund’, then any profits arising from transfer of units of such fund are taxable at a rate of 30% \\nin case of short-term capital gains, and 20% in case of long-term capital gains. \\n \\nAs per Section 14A of the Income Tax Act, any expenses incurred by the Category III AIF in \\nmanaging the investments, including Management Fees, Fixed expenses and Performance \\nFees, shall be disallowed to be treated as expenses incurred in connection with the transfer \\nof the asset. As per this section, no deduction is allowed in respect of expenditure incurred \\nby the Fund, in relation to income which does not form part of the total income of the Fund. \\nSince Capital Gains are taxed in the hands of the investors, expenditure incurred by the fund \\ndoes not qualify for a deduction. Hence, investors are not given the benefit of expenses, and \\nare directly or indirectly borne by them, in proportion of their value of investments in the \\nfund. \\n \\n• Applicability of Stamp Duty \\n \\nGovernment of India has introduced the regime of uniform stamp duty rates across the \\ncountry, thereby simplifying the collection process. Issue, transfer and sale of units of the \\n306 | P a g e  \\n \\nCategory III AIF are subject to stamp duty. The fund operations may also include professional \\ntax, local municipal taxes or Securities Transaction Tax (STT), for any operations conducted \\non listed securities. \\n \\nThe Finance Act, 2019 has made certain amendments in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 whereby \\nstamp duty shall be levied as follows, on relevant investments for Category III AIFs:  \\n1. On derivatives i.e. futures, options, currency and interest rate derivatives and other \\nderivatives, government securities, repo on corporate bonds;  \\n2. On transfer of securities through demat form and units;  \\n3. On transfer of listed securities (on-market or off-market), unlisted securities in demat \\nform as well as on issue of securities;  \\n4. On issue or transfer of shares otherwise than through a stock exchange or a \\ndepository; \\n5. On all kinds of debentures as defined in section 2(10A) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. \\n \\nThe Central Government has notified the Registrars to Issue and / or Share Transfer Agents \\n(RTAs) to act as collecting agents.140 In this regard SEBI has also issued a circular stating that \\nRTAs shall collect stamp duty on issue, transfer and sale of units of AIFs.141 \\n \\nExample 3: Capital Gains on Transfer of units of a Category III AIF \\n \\nLet us take the example of Fund TM, to understand the applicability of capital gains on \\ntransfer of units by investors. \\n \\nFund TM was launched in the year 2017, as an Irrevocable, Determinate Trust, with an aim to \\nprimarily make equity investments and debt investments only. Fund Expiry is on March 31, \\n2021. \\nParticulars \\nAmount \\nCommitted Capital (Rs.) \\n60,00,00,000 \\nNo. of units issued \\n6,00,000  \\nNAV (Rs.) \\n1000.00  \\n \\nThe fund has issued the below-mentioned class of units: \\nClass of Units \\nNo. of Units Price (NAV) \\nCommitment (Rs.) \\nClass A Units \\n3,00,000 \\n1000.00 \\n30,00,00,000.00  \\nClass B Units \\n1,50,000 \\n1000.00 \\n15,00,00,000.00  \\nClass F Units \\n1,50,000 \\n1000.00 \\n15,00,00,000.00  \\nTotal Capital Commitments \\n6,00,000 \\n  \\n60,00,00,000.00  \\n                                                          \\n \\n140The amendments to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 brought through Finance Act, 2019 and Rules made \\nthereunder w.e.f. 1st July, 2020 vide notifications dated March 30, 2020. \\n141SEBI Circular No.: SEBI/HO/IMD/DF6/CIR/P/2020/113 dated June 30, 2020 on Collection of stamp duty on \\nissue, transfer and sale of units of AIFs. \\n307 | P a g e  \\n \\nOn April 15, 2020, the investors in Class B units transfer the units to new Class C units, at an \\nNAV of Rs. 1150.00 per unit. The fund was liquidated on March 31, 2021 by making \\ndistributions to all its investors at a NAV of Rs. 1225 per unit. \\n \\nCompute the capital gains payable by all the investors in the fund, during the life of the fund \\nand at the expiry of the term of the fund. \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\nAll class of units have different holding periods. As per section 45 of the Income Tax Act, if \\nunits of an ‘equity-oriented investment fund’ are held for more than 12 months immediately \\npreceding the date of its transfer, any gain from the sale of such units is classified as a ‘Long \\nTerm Capital Gain’. For the purpose of this example, it is assumed that Fund TM is classified \\nas an ‘equity-oriented investment fund’. \\n \\nComputation of Holding Period for all Class of Units: \\n \\nClass of Units \\nPeriod of Holding \\nTerm \\nClass A Units \\nApril 01, 2017 to March 31, 2021 \\nLong-term \\nClass B Units \\nApril 01, 2017 to April 15, 2020 \\nLong-term \\nClass F Units \\nApril 01, 2017 to March 31, 2021 \\nLong-term \\nClass C Units  \\nApril 15, 2020 to March 31, 2021 \\nShort-term \\n \\nIn view of the above, Class C unit investors will be liable to pay ‘short-term capital gain tax’, \\non transfer of units of Fund TI, at 15%, as holding period of the units is less than 12 months, \\nfrom the date of investment. Similarly, all other investors will be liable to pay ‘long-term \\ncapital gain tax’, on transfer of units of Fund TI, at 10%, as holding period of the units is more \\nthan 12 months, from the date of investment. \\n \\nComputation of Long-Term Capital Gains and Tax Liability: Class A, B and F Units \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmounts (Rs.) \\nClass B Units \\nClass A Units \\nClass F Units \\nFull Value of Consideration: \\n \\nClass B Units:1,50,000 units of Fund TI \\nsold @ Rs. 1150 per unit \\n \\nClass A Units: 3,00,000 units of Fund \\nTI sold @ Rs. 1225 per unit \\n \\nClass F Units: 1,50,000 units of Fund \\nTI sold @ Rs. 1225 per unit \\n17,25,00,000 \\n36,75,00,000 \\n18,37,50,000 \\nLess: Cost of Acquisition \\n(15,00,00,000) \\n(30,00,00,000) \\n(15,00,00,000) \\n308 | P a g e  \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmounts (Rs.) \\nClass B Units \\nClass A Units \\nClass F Units \\n@ Rs. 1000 per unit \\nLong Term Capital Gain \\n2,25,00,000 \\n6,75,00,000 \\n3,37,50,000 \\nTax on Capital Gains \\nLong Term Capital Gains Tax @ 10% \\n22,50,000  \\n67,50,000 \\n33,75,000  \\nAdd: Surcharge @ 15% \\n3,37,500  \\n10,12,500 \\n5,06,250  \\nAdd: Health & Education Cess @ 4% \\n1,03,500 \\n3,10,500 \\n1,55,250  \\nTotal Long Term Capital Gains Tax \\n26,91,000 \\n80,73,000 \\n40,36,500 \\n \\nComputation of Short Term Capital Gains and Tax Liability: Class C Units \\n \\nParticulars \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nFull Value of Consideration: \\n \\n1,50,000 units of Fund TI sold @ Rs. 1225 per unit \\n18,37,50,000 \\nLess: Cost of Acquisition @ Rs. 1150 per unit \\n 17,25,00,000 \\nShort Term Capital Gain \\n1,12,50,000  \\n \\n \\nTax on Capital Gains \\n \\nShort Term Capital Gains Tax @ 15% \\n16,87,500  \\nAdd: Surcharge @ 15% \\n2,53,125 \\nAdd: Cess @ 4% \\n77,625 \\nTotal Short Term Capital Gains Tax \\n20,18,250 \\n \\nIn the secondary market, investors may transfer the units of a Category III AIF by paying a \\nstamp duty of 0.015%, whether listed on a stock exchange or not. Due to multiple secondary \\ntransfers, it is likely that the composition of the pool of investors may change from time to \\ntime for the AIF, such as: \\no The investors at the time of making investments, by a Category III AIF may be different \\nfrom investors at the time of earning/receiving income, by the fund. \\no The investors at the time of earning/receiving income, by the Category III AIF may be \\ndifferent from the investors at the time of distribution of income by the fund. \\n \\nExample 4: Tax Basis Step-up Method   \\n \\n• January 20, 2020 - Mr. X has subscribed to 10,00,000 units of a Category III AIF – Fund \\nA at a NAV of Rs. 500 per unit. \\n• January 31, 2020 - Fund A has subscribed to an unlisted debenture of PM Ltd., with \\n12% coupon and market rate of Rs. 100. The investment is worth Rs. 5 crore. \\n• March 31, 2020 - Fund A receives two-month interest of Rs. 2 per debenture, totalling \\nto Rs. 10 lakhs. \\n• April 02, 2020 - Mr. X transfers the units to Mr. Y, at a NAV of Rs. 550 per unit.  \\n309 | P a g e  \\n \\n• April 05, 2020 - Fund A distributes total interest income, attributable to 10,00,000 \\nunits, to the incoming unit holder, Mr. Y. \\n• March 15, 2021 - Fund A sells the investments in debentures at Rs. 125. \\n \\nAnalyse the investment returns and taxability of income for each unit holder in Fund A.  \\n \\nSolution: \\n \\no As per section 194LBB, Fund A will withhold tax at the time of accrual of interest \\nincome to the unitholder – Mr. X. Fund A deducts tax at 10% on interest received, in \\nthe hands of Mr. X. However, the interest was not actually distributed to Mr. X. \\n \\no Income distribution is made to the new unit-holder - Mr. Y, who is liable to pay tax on \\nthe interest income received, at the relevant slab rate. \\n \\no The fund has sold the debentures in less than 36 months from the date of purchase. \\nHence, short-term capital gains is payable on the sale transaction, at the hands of Mr. \\nY, as per Section 10 (23FBA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.  \\n \\no Tax on Short-term capital gains is payable by Mr. Y at 42.744%, assuming annual \\nincome of Mr. Y is above Rs. 5 crore, in Financial Year 2020-2021.The concessional rate \\nof Surcharge, under section 111A will not apply in this case, as Fund A has invested in \\nunlisted debentures.  \\n \\no Tax is paid on total gain of Rs. 12.50 crore (i.e. Rs. 62.50 crore – Rs. 50 crore) which \\namounts to Rs. 5.34 crore. In comparison, the total investment made by Mr. Y was Rs. \\n55 crore. In this scenario, Mr. Y would have to suffer a loss on the specific investment \\nmade by Fund A in the debenture, instead of earning interest for the financial year. \\n \\nAs seen above, the incoming investor in the Fund is at a tax-disadvantage, with a risk of \\npotential tax payments on income generated by the fund. Moreover, the exiting investor is \\nalso at a disadvantage, as withholding taxes are deducted by the Fund for income not \\ndistributed to such investor. In order to avoid this, a Category III AIF is recommended to follow \\na ‘tax basis step-up’ method to value its securities, on the date of the transfer of interest to \\nthe incoming investor, on fair value basis. SEBI Alternative Investment Policy Advisory \\nCommittee (AIPAC) has suggested implementation of this valuation method, in its final \\nrecommendation report submitted to SEBI. \\n \\nUsing the tax basis step-up method, the Category III AIF will value every security in the \\nportfolio at the fair value on those dates when a new investor is investing in the fund. This \\nfair value will be taken as the base value of investment for purpose of capital gains, for the \\nincoming investor, who shall then pay taxes on any capital gains on the increase in value of \\nthe security, over and above the base value. This reduces the tax anomalies and increases \\ntransparency for all individuals in the Category III AIF. \\n \\nLet us continue the illustration of Fund A: \\n310 | P a g e  \\n \\no In this illustration, we assume that Fund A had taken the fair value of the debenture \\non April 2, 2020, which is the date of transfer of units to the new investor, Mr. Y.  \\n \\no The value as on April 2, 2020 was Rs. 110, considering the NAV of Rs. 550 per unit. \\n \\no In this case, the short term capital gain tax payable by Mr. Y would be on total gain of \\nRs. 7.50 crore (i.e. Rs. 62.50 crore – Rs.55 crore) which amounts to Rs. 3.21 crore. \\n \\no This reduces the tax liability of Mr. Y by Rs. 2.13 crore, in the year he earns Capital \\nGains on transfer of the units of Fund A, i.e. Financial Year 2020-2021. \\n \\nAs seen above, the base value taken for the purpose of computing capital gains for the \\nincoming investor, Mr. Y, is the fair value of the security as on the date of transfer of units of \\nthe Category III AIF by Mr. X. \\n \\n9.7 Tax applicability to Category III AIFs in IFSC  \\n \\nAn IFSC is formed with the objective to encourage foreign investors to invest in Indian AIFs \\nand facilitate financial services and transactions in India, which are currently being carried out \\nby overseas financial institutions or overseas branches of Indian financial institutions, in \\ninternational financial hubs like Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, London, Ireland, Luxemburg, \\nMauritius, among others. The Central Government and Ministry of Finance have implemented \\nmultiple reforms to promote AIFs being set-up in an IFSC. At present, India has an IFSC, which \\nis the Gujarat International Finance Tech-City (GIFT City) in Gujarat. The GIFT City provides a \\nfavourable business environment for Category III AIFs domiciled in the IFSC, with easy access \\nto capital pools, state-of-art infrastructure and transportation facilities, growth-oriented \\nregulatory reforms, availability of human capital and macro-economic stability. \\n \\nThe IFSCA, headquartered at GIFT City, Gandhinagar, has been established on April 27, 2020 \\nunder the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019. The IFSCA is a unified \\nauthority for the development and regulation of financial products, financial services and \\nfinancial institutions in the IFSC in India. It plays a crucial role of a unified regulator, to \\npromote ease of doing business in the IFSC and provide a world-class regulatory environment. \\n \\nThe International Financial Services Centres Authority has made the International Financial \\nServices Centres Authority (Fund Management) Regulations, 2022 to regulate fund \\nmanagement entities, such as a Category III AIF, as per the Finance Act, 2023. \\n \\nIndirect Tax Regime: \\n \\nCategory III AIFs operating from IFSC are exempt from GST, which enables them to offer a \\ncompetent investment platform to foreign portfolio investors, similar to other popular off-\\nshore destinations. The GST payable on Management Fees and Trusteeship Fees will not be \\nindirectly borne by the investors in the Category III AIF. \\n \\n311 | P a g e  \\n \\nDirect Tax Regime: \\n \\nIncome Tax Act, 1961, imposes source-based taxation on non-residents whereby, income \\nreceived or arising or deemed to be received or arising to a non-resident in India would be \\nsubject to tax in India. Therefore, income received by a non-resident becomes chargeable to \\ntax either when it is ‘received\\' or is \\'deemed to be received\\' in India by such non-resident or \\nwhen it \\'accrues\\' or \\'arises\\' or is \\'deemed to accrue or arise\\' to him in India during the previous \\nyear. \\n \\nWhen a Category III AIF receives investments from a non-resident investor, and uses such \\ncapital contributions to make overseas investments, the income so generated could be \\ndeemed to be a direct investment by a non-resident, and hence not subject to tax in India. In \\nthis regard, the CBDT clarified that such income received by non-residents from offshore \\ninvestments made through Category I AIFs and Category II AIFs would not be subject to tax in \\nIndia. This exemption has now been extended to Category III AIFs set-up in an IFSC. Foreign \\nInvestors earning capital gains from the transfer of overseas investments, made by a Category \\nIII AIF set-up in an IFSC, is exempt from tax. \\n \\nAs per the provisions of GAAR, an off-shore investment structure or off-shore transaction \\ncould be deemed impermissible, and hence chargeable to tax. CBDT has clarified that GAAR \\nshall not be invoked merely on the ground that an entity is located in a tax efficient \\njurisdiction. This encourages Category III AIFs to establish offices in IFSCs and attract capital \\ncommitments from foreign investors and domestic investors. \\n \\nThe Direct Tax regime for Category III AIFs located in an IFSC is similar to the tax regime for \\nother Category III AIFs, with the following additional benefits being extended to such AIFs: \\n \\n• Tax holiday under Section 80LA: \\nAny unit of a Category III AIF set-up in an IFSC can avail a 100% deduction from the Gross Total \\nIncome arising from activities as an AIF, for any 10 consecutive years out of a period of 15 \\nyears, beginning with the year in which the requisite permission for the operation of the fund \\nwas obtained \\n• Lower rates of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT): \\nMAT is applicable at the rate of 9%, as opposed to the general rate of 18.5%, in case of units \\nof a Category III AIF located in an IFSC, deriving its income solely in convertible foreign \\nexchange. \\n• Exemption from Securities Transaction Tax (STT): \\nA transaction undertaken on a recognised stock exchange in an IFSC shall be exempt from \\nSTT, and shall be eligible for taxation at concessional tax rates for short-term capital gains, \\nunder Section 111A, and for long-term capital gains, under Section 112A. \\n312 | P a g e  \\n \\n• Tax Benefits under the Taxation Act, 2020: \\nThe Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020 \\n(Taxation Act, 2020) provides certain relaxations in the Income Tax provisions applicable to \\nCategory III AIFs, if:  \\n \\n \\no The Category III AIF is located in an IFSC and registered with SEBI as per the provisions \\nof the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 \\no The Category III AIF is formed as a Trust, Company or a Limited Liability Partnership \\no The Category III AIF has obtained a Certificate of Registration as a Foreign Portfolio \\nInvestor, under the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019. This is \\nmandatory as the Category III AIF is considered as a ‘person resident outside India’. \\nInvestments made by such Category III AIF are subject to the investment restrictions \\napplicable to Foreign Portfolio Investors. \\no All units issued by the Category III AIF are held by non-resident investors, other than \\nunits held by the investment manager and sponsor of the fund. \\n \\nThe following tax benefits are provided to Category III AIFs located in an IFSC, as per the \\nTaxation Act, 2020: \\n \\nThe Taxation Act, 2020 provides exemptions to a Category III AIF located in IFSC, on the \\nfollowing sources of income: \\no Any income accrued, arisen to, or received as a result of transfer of securities, \\nother than shares of an Indian company. Thus, gains on transfer of derivatives or \\ndebt securities or offshore securities shall be exempt. \\no Any income received from transfer of debt securities or derivatives issued by \\nIndian companies, irrespective of whether such securities are listed on a stock \\nexchange located in IFSC. \\no Any income received from transfer of securities, held in the form of overseas \\ninvestments. \\n \\nExemption on Income received from a Securitization Trust under ‘Profits and Gains from \\nBusiness and Profession’: \\nAny income received by a Category III AIF located in an IFSC, from a Securitization Trust under \\n‘Profits and Gains from Business and Profession’ is exempt from tax, to the extent such \\nincome is attributable to units held by non-residents.  \\n \\nExemptions to Unit Holders in the Category III AIF: \\nAs per section 10(23FBC) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, any income accrued, arising to, or \\nreceived by unit holders from a Category III AIF located in an IFSC or on transfer of units of \\nsuch Category III AIF has been exempted from tax. \\n \\n \\n \\n313 | P a g e  \\n \\nExemption from Alternate Minimum Tax: \\nAs per the amendment to section 115JEE of the Income Tax Act, 1961, Category III AIFs located \\nin an IFSC, organised as Trusts or LLPs, have been exempted from the applicability of Alternate \\nMinimum Tax provisions.  \\n \\nTax Rates for Category III AIFs domiciled in an IFSC: \\nThe Taxation Act, 2020 has amended Section 115AD of the Income Tax Act, 1961, to provide \\na flat rate of taxation for income earned by Category III AIFs domiciled in an IFSC and bring \\nthem at par with the tax rates applicable for Foreign Portfolio Investors. It is pertinent to note \\nthat the maximum rate of surcharge applicable on long-term capital gains, short-term capital \\ngains, interest income and dividend income is 15%.  \\n \\nTable 9.2 summarizes the tax rates applicable to Category III AIFs domiciled in an IFSC: \\nTable9.2:  Tax Rates Applicable to Category III AIFs domiciled in IFSC: \\nNature of Income \\nCategory III \\nAIFs in IFSC \\n(registered as \\nFPI)1 \\nForeign \\nPortfolio \\nInvestors \\n(FPI)1 \\nDividend Income \\n10% \\n20% \\nInterest Income from: \\no Government Securities or Municipal Debt \\nsecurities \\no Rupee-denominated Bonds of an Indian Company \\n5% \\n5% \\nOther Interest Income \\n10% \\n20% \\nLong-term capital gains  \\n10% \\n10% \\nShort-term capital gains under section 111A, from: \\no sale of listed equity shares \\no units of equity-oriented mutual funds \\no units of business trust \\n15% \\n15% \\nOther Short-term capital gains \\n30% \\n30% \\n1Tax Rates are excluding applicable Surcharge and Health and Education Cess. \\nWithholding Obligations for Category III AIFs domiciled in an IFSC: \\nThe Taxation Act, 2020 clarifies that the person responsible for paying any income, other than \\ncapital gains, to Category III AIFs domiciled in an IFSC, shall withhold tax at rate of 10% at the \\ntime of credit or payment, whichever is earlier. Interest income from rupee-denominated \\nbonds, government securities or municipal debt securities referred to in Section 194LD of the \\nAct, are subject to withholding at a reduced rate of 5%. No withholding tax is applicable on \\nCapital Gains on transfer of securities accruing to Category III AIFs domiciled in an IFSC. \\n \\n \\n \\n314 | P a g e  \\n \\nTax Rates for Non-Resident Investors investing in Category III AIFs domiciled in an IFSC: \\n \\nAny income accruing or arising to, or received from the Category III AIF domiciled in an IFSC \\nshall be exempt from tax in the hands of investors. Any income on transfer of units in the \\nCategory III AIF shall also be exempt from tax in the hands of investors. \\n \\nThe surcharge on dividends earned by non-corporate FPIs, is capped at 15%. Hence, the \\nenhanced Surcharge Rate of 25%, for foreign portfolio investors with total income above Rs. \\n2 crore, and 37%, for foreign portfolio investors with total income above Rs. 5 crore, is not \\napplicable. \\n \\n9.8 Tax impact on performance of Category III AIF \\n \\nThe choice of jurisdiction is important for a Category III AIF. As discussed above, setting-up \\nthe AIF in an IFSC enjoys tax benefit, in comparison to an AIF set-up in other jurisdictions \\nwithin India. Similarly, certain off-shore jurisdictions, such as Mauritius, Singapore or \\nNetherlands provide tax benefits on income accrued and received in India, based on the \\nDouble Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) signed between income tax authorities of India and \\nthe tax authorities of such jurisdiction.  \\n \\nIn order to claim tax benefits under the DTAA, the non-resident investor shall obtain a Tax \\nResidency Certificate (TRC), issued by the concerned foreign tax authorities and provide \\nadditional information or documents to the authorities, as prescribed. In this connection, the \\nCBDT, vide its notification dated August 1, 2013, has prescribed certain information to be \\nprovided in Form No. 10F, along with the Tax Residency Certificate, if such information is not \\npresent in the concerned Tax Residency Certificate. The taxability of income of the non-\\nresident investor, in the absence of a Tax Residency Certificate, or from a country with which \\nIndia has no DTAA, would be subject to tax, as per provisions of the Income Tax Act.  \\n \\nIndia and Mauritius have a DTAA, which exempted a resident of Mauritius from paying income \\ntax in India, on capital gains derived from the sale of shares of an Indian company. The \\nprovisions of the India-Mauritius DTAA were changed through a Protocol signed between \\nIndia and Mauritius on May 10, 2016. The Protocol gave India a source-based right to tax \\ncapital gains which arise from sale of shares of an Indian resident company acquired by a \\nMauritian tax resident. The Protocol had provided for grandfathering of investments, making \\nthe protocol applicable to investments made on or after April 1, 2017. Hence, all existing \\ninvestments up to March 31, 2017 had been grandfathered and sale or transfer of such shares \\nbeyond this date would not be subject to capital gains tax in India. The modification on capital \\ngains taxation is limited to gains arising on sale of shares. This ensures continuity of tax \\nbenefits on sale of other instruments. The sale of debentures continues to enjoy tax benefits \\nunder the India-Mauritius DTAA, with a lower withholding tax rate of 7.5% for interest income \\nearned by Mauritius investors from India. The withholding tax rate offered under the \\nMauritius DTAA is significantly lower than those rates specified in other DTAAs signed with \\nSingapore (15%) and Netherlands (10%). \\n \\n315 | P a g e  \\n \\nIndia and Singapore also signed a protocol on December 30, 2016 to amend the India-\\nSingapore DTAA. The amendments introduced were largely to provide for source-based \\ntaxation of capital gains arising out of sale of Indian shares held by Singapore residents as \\nopposed to residence-based taxation for the same.  \\n \\nIndia-Netherlands DTAA provides relief against capital gains tax in India. Gains arising to a \\nDutch resident, from sale of shares of an Indian company to non-resident buyer, would not \\nbe taxable in India. However, such gains would be taxable if a Dutch resident holds more than \\n10% of shares of an Indian company and the sale of shares is made to Indian residents. \\n \\nThe Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released the \\nMultilateral Convention to implement Treaty related measures to prevent Base Erosion and \\nProfit Shifting (MLI). The MLI includes a principal purpose test, wherein tax benefits under \\na DTAA can be denied if one of the principal purposes of an arrangement or a transaction was \\nto, directly or indirectly, obtain tax benefit. This test is also applicable for an agent in an \\noffshore jurisdiction, excluding an independent agent, who plays a principal role in \\ninvestment management activities in such offshore jurisdiction. For this purpose, an agent \\nshall not be considered independent, if such agent acts exclusively on behalf of one or more \\nclosely related enterprises. Hence, a Category III AIF must ensure that any tax benefits, under \\na DTAA, are not withdrawn on account of its Organization structure. Determining the tax \\njurisdiction is important for a Category III AIF, as it significantly impacts the direct tax liabilities \\nand indirect tax liabilities, thus reducing the Net IRR or return to the investors in the Fund.  \\n \\n9.8.1 Pre and Post Tax Returns of a Category III AIF \\n \\nExample 5: Comparison of Direct Taxes: \\n \\nFund INT was launched on February 19, 2019 in GIFT City Gujarat, to raise capital \\ncommitments worth USD 14 million from foreign investors and make investments in securities \\nlisted on a stock exchange in GIFT City.

Analyse the results. \\nSolution: \\n \\nFund INT is set-up in an IFSC and has raised all its committed capital from foreign investors. \\nAs per Section 47(viia) of the Income Tax Act, any transfer by Fund INT of specified assets, \\nsuch as Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), Rupee-denominated Bond (RDBs) of an Indian \\ncompany, derivatives, units of a mutual fund or units of a business trust listed on a stock \\nexchange located in IFSC, would not be regarded as ‘transfer’. Hence, Fund INT is EXEMPT \\nfrom Capital Gains arising from sale of equity-oriented units of Fund EQMF. Further, the fund \\nhas done transactions in convertible foreign currency. \\n \\nUnder Section 112A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, Fund DOM is liable to pay tax on Long-Term \\nCapital Gains arising from sale of units of equity-oriented units of Fund EQMF. The \\nconcessional rate of 10% is applicable, as the units were held for more than 12 months, from \\nthe date of purchase and STT was paid on the sale transaction. \\n \\nApplicable surcharge rate is 15%, as per Section 112A, and Health and Education Cess is 4%. \\n317 | P a g e  \\n \\nComputation of Capital Gains and Tax Liability - Fund INT and Fund DOM: \\n \\nParticulars \\nFund DOM \\nFund INT \\nAmount (Rs.) \\nAmount ($) \\nFull Value of Consideration: \\n \\n \\n20,00,000 units equity-oriented scheme of Fund EQMF \\n36,75,00,000 \\n5,000,000  \\nLess: Cost of Acquisition: \\n 28,00,00,000 \\n 4,000,000  \\nLong Term Capital Gain \\n8,75,00,000 \\n1,000,000  \\n \\n \\n \\nTax on Capital Gains \\n \\n \\nTax on Long Term Capital Gains @ 10% \\n87,50,000  \\nEXEMPT \\nAdd: Surcharge @ 15% \\n13,12,500 \\n- \\nAdd: Cess @ 4% \\n4,02,500 \\n- \\nTotal Long Term Capital Gains Tax \\n1,04,65,000 \\nEXEMPT \\n \\nFund DOM is paying Rs.1,04,65,000 in tax on ‘capital gains’ as the Fund is not domiciled in an \\nIFSC, as compared to Fund INT which does not pay any tax on gains from such transfer.  \\n9.8.2 Impact of GST on Fees \\n \\nCategory III AIFs pay professional fees on an annual basis to multiple service providers, such \\nas Fund Administrators, Registrars, Custodians, Auditors, Brokers, Investment Advisors and \\nother third-party professional experts. The services provided by such external service \\nproviders are taxable on a yearly basis, at the rate of 18% of GST. Apart from services of \\nexternal service providers, the fund also pays Management Fees and Trusteeship Fees, which \\nare taxable at the rate of 18% of GST. This substantially impacts the cost of investments for \\nthe fund and can decrease the potential returns for investors. \\n \\nCategory III AIFs operating from an IFSC are exempt from GST. Hence, the fees payable to the \\ninvestment manager, trustee and the external service providers, are not taxable.  \\n \\nExample 6: Comparison of Indirect Taxes \\n \\nFund G was launched on April 1, 2019 in GIFT City Gujarat, to raise capital commitments worth \\nUSD 14 million from foreign investors and make investments in securities listed on a stock \\nexchange in GIFT City.

Details of Additional Returns, along-with catch-up \\nprovisions and hurdle rate applicable for each class of units \\no Key service providers and governance mechanisms \\no Investor Reporting mechanism \\no Contact Details of Investment Manager or Point of Contact at the fund \\n \\n• Key Risk Factors: \\n \\nKey risk factors should be extracted from the detailed disclosures provided in the Private \\nPlacement Memorandum (PPM) and most important risk factors applicable to the \\nfund/scheme should be disclosed in the Pitch Book, such as: \\n323 | P a g e  \\n \\no Risk Factors related to Portfolio Investments \\no Risk Factors related to Fund Structure \\no Regulatory Risk Factors  \\no General Risk Factors \\no Tax-related Risk Factors \\no Sector-specific Risk Factors \\no Currency-related Risk Factors \\n \\nThe Distributor should be able to prepare a Sales Pitch to potential investors in the \\nfund/scheme. The Distributors’ Sales Pitch includes Product Analysis on the basis of the \\ninvestment strategy of the fund/scheme, inherited costs, risks and return in the fund, product \\nsuitability of the fund based on risk profiling etc. It is advisable to maintain a Distribution Kit, \\nwith the following information and documents: \\n \\no Copies of Fund Constitution and SEBI Registration Certificate of the \\nfund/scheme \\no Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) issued by the Category III AIF \\no Distributor’s Investor Presentation \\no Key Disclosure Statement, extracted from the PPM  \\no Key timelines with respect to the fund/scheme \\no KYC documentation requirements, as per FEMA, PMLA and other applicable \\nlaws  \\no Relevant forms for investors in different constitutions and jurisdictions \\no Note on Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requirements and FATCA \\ndeclaration forms \\no Expert opinions, if any \\no Essential approvals, if any, required for the investment \\no FAQs on the scheme, fund, sponsor, investment manager, investment process, \\ninvestor eligibility, tax laws and regulations, risk profiling and stock selection.  \\no Co-ordinates of key officials and relationship managers from the distributor’s \\noffice \\n \\n10.2 Role of Distributors – Pre-investment and Post-investment \\n \\nDistributors are a vital link between Category III AIF managers and High Net-worth Individual \\n(HNI) investors or Institutional investors. As the AIF investment community consists of large \\ninstitutional investors and HNI investors, whether domestic or offshore, distributor skills and \\ncompetence levels have to match up to the expectations of such informed investors. \\n \\nInstitutional investors prefer transparent disclosures on the performance of the Category III \\nAIF, to help them make investment and exit decisions. Further, institutional investors need to \\n324 | P a g e  \\n \\nensure that they invest in such Category III AIFs, and in such quantum, which are suitable to \\ntheir investment mandate and risk appetite. Considering Category III AIF investments may be \\nilliquid as well as have higher market risk, investors need to analyse the investment strategy \\nadopted by such fund and ascertain the expected return from the fund. Fee Structure and \\nTaxation Structure of the fund also plays a vital role in the decision-making process of the \\ninvestors in a Category III AIF. \\n \\nDistributors have the obligation to understand and stay updated with the development in the \\nAlternative Investments market, taxation reforms and characteristics of the Category III AIF \\nunits being distributed. This enables them to match a specific Category III AIF unit with \\ninvestor profiles and their risk-appetite. Marketing, Sales, Investor Support and Relationship \\nManagement form the four pillars of AIF distributorship. As Category III AIFs have a long \\ngestation period, till the fund expiry, a long-term engagement with investment managers and \\ninvestors is crucial. This helps Distributors in generating more investment opportunities for \\nfollow-on funds or schemes launched by a Category III AIF. \\n \\nThe commercial arrangement between the Category III AIF and the distributor is based on \\nmarketing commissions. Distributor services are the key differentiators to establish the \\ndistributor’s activity leadership, build a clientele and relationship with Category III AIFs. The \\nkey elements of distributor services are listed below: \\n \\n \\n• Pre-Commitment Services \\n \\no Engagement with investment managers to obtain information on upcoming \\nfund/scheme launch \\no Preparation of Pitch Books and Distribution Kits \\no Engagement with institutional investors and HNI investors, wealth managers, \\nportfolio managers, family offices, and representatives of foreign investors to \\norganize investor meets and closed-door marketing activities \\no Presenting the Investment Strategy and introducing the fund/scheme in initial \\nmeetings with investors and soliciting investor interest \\no Explaining the key disclosures and risk factors of the fund/scheme and \\nascertaining the suitability of the fund/scheme for potential investors \\no Compiling additional information requirements or documents for investors \\nand procuring the same from the investment manager \\no Facilitating Fund Due Diligence by investors \\no Seeking consent for capital commitment \\no Assisting in the transaction process and completion of related documentation \\n \\nIn order to provide the above-mentioned services to investors in the Category III AIF, it is \\nessential for the distributors to stay informed and updated on the Investment Strategy, \\ninherent Risk Factors and any changes in the Investment Strategy. Material changes made by \\n325 | P a g e  \\n \\nthe Investment Manager in the Investment Strategy should be informed to the Distributor. \\nThe Distributor should be obliged to inform such changes, and its potential impact on the \\ntotal risk and suitability of the revised investment strategy, to every existing investor and \\npotential investors. Material changes to the investment strategy include changes such as: \\no Change in the target sectors and/or target industries \\no Change in target holding period of investments and exit strategy \\no Change in target allocation to various asset classes or securities \\no Change in valuation methodology and policies \\no Increase or decrease in target leverage, due to change in leverage strategy \\no Impact on the estimated return of the fund, due to deviation in the strategy \\n \\nIn addition to the above-mentioned services to be provided by Distributors, before raising \\ncapital for a Category III AIF, the following services should also be provided to investors and \\nfunds, after the investments are received from investors and invested by the investment \\nmanager. \\n \\n• Post-Investment Services \\n \\no Interact with investors, Category III AIF and the investment manager for co-\\nordinating periodic capital calls and drawdown notices. The distributor should \\nfacilitate transfer of funds, incidental processes connected with each \\ndrawdown transaction and related documentation. \\no Interact with investors to get investor approval, if any, on behalf of the \\nCategory III AIF and intimate the same to the investment manager, as per the \\nprovisions of SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations. \\no Serve as a Point of Contact (POC) for any support with respect to investor’s \\nrequirements such as receipt of periodic investor reports from the investment \\nmanager. \\no Facilitate meetings between the investment manager and investors, along-\\nwith incidental procedural and administrative requirements. \\no Assist in forwarding investor requirements, with respect to co-investments and \\nreport on fund performance and investor grievances to the investment \\nmanager. \\no Marketing the follow-on fund/scheme of the Category III AIF and thereby \\nperform the related processes with respect to marketing. \\n \\n10.3 Client Confidentiality and Data Privacy at Distributor Level \\n \\nThe Distributors Agreement signed between the Category III AIF manager and the Distributor \\ncontains the scope of services and legal clauses, enforceable under law. One of the key clauses \\nin the agreement is in respect to Confidentiality and Privacy of Data, relating to fund and its \\n326 | P a g e  \\n \\ninvestors. As discussed above, pitch book is confidential to the investment manager of a \\nCategory III AIF and is meant for private circulation only. Similarly, data shared by the \\ninvestment managers with respect to investment strategy, investment process, target \\nallocations, target sectors, time horizon, fund life, expected returns, fund terms and fee \\nstructure of the fund/scheme is confidential in nature. Such data is proprietary to the \\nCategory III AIF, deemed to be owned by the fund and can be categorized as ‘Financial Data’ \\nunder the Data Protection Bill, 2018. Sharing of financial data would result in a breach of data \\nprivacy and confidentiality, resulting in suitable penalties and remedies under the Bill and/or \\nas mentioned in the contract signed between the Category III AIF and Distributor. \\n \\nImplementation of adequate internal controls is crucial for Distributors, considering the use \\nof technology in every business operation. Confidentiality can be compromised by internal \\nand external factors, such as Espionage, Cyber-crime and Data Theft. Distributors should \\nimplement an internal Confidentiality Policy, to ensuring that data of investors and \\ninvestment managers is not compromised. Such Confidentiality Policy should be \\ncommunicated to employees of the Distributor, including personnel in teams, inter-alia \\nincluding Sales, Investor Relations, Client On-boarding, Relationship Management, Customer \\nService and other teams. Moreover, the policy should be made binding on all employees, \\nincluding board members, partners, directors as well as third-party service providers on-\\nboarded by the distributor on a contractual basis. The policy should provide a clear list of \\ncompulsory actions, as well as prohibited actions, in order to ensure confidentiality of data. \\n \\n• Confidentiality Measures: \\n \\nConfidential and proprietary information is secret, valuable, expensive or easily replicated.  \\n \\nBest practices include: \\no Encryption of electronic information and safeguarding databases \\no Ask employees to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) \\no Have Firewalls set-up, when permitting external sources to access the \\ncompany server \\no Take back-up of confidential data at frequent regular intervals, and store a \\ncopy of such back-up at a Disaster Recovery Site \\no Store and lock paper documents \\no Ask for authorization by senior management to allow employees to access \\ncertain confidential information \\n \\nEmployees who do not respect the Distributor’s Confidentiality Policy should be held liable \\nfor disciplinary action. The employees should: \\n \\no View confidential information on secure devices \\no Disclose information to other employees when it’s necessary and authorized \\no Not have access to portable storage devices on their personal computers \\no Not have access to personal emails \\no Secure confidential information, with passwords and encryptions \\n327 | P a g e  \\n \\no Shred confidential documents, when not required \\no Keep confidential documents inside within office premises, unless it’s \\nabsolutely necessary to move them \\n \\nThe employees should not: \\no Use confidential information for any personal benefit or profit \\no Disclose confidential information to anyone outsider and third-party, without \\nauthorization \\no Replicate confidential documents and files and store them on personal storage \\ndevices \\n \\nConfidential information may occasionally be disclosed for legitimate reasons, such as: \\no If a regulatory body requests it as part of an investigation or audit \\no If it is required under contract, to be shared with specific third parties \\n \\nIn such cases, employees having access to such data should document their disclosure \\nprocedure and collect necessary authorizations. \\n \\n10.4 Code of Conduct \\n \\nGood practices in distribution of Category III AIFs are necessary to establish credibility, trust, \\nreputation and global standards of excellence. This benefits the Distributors as well to \\nestablish a leadership position in the Alternative Investments eco-system. Good practices also \\nhelp in meeting the regulatory intent behind the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) \\nRegulations, in serving the best interests of investors investing in AIFs. \\n \\nEvery Distributor should formulate an Internal Code of Conduct, which should be \\ncommunicated to its employees and external service providers engaged by such Distributor. \\nThe intent behind establishing the Internal Code of Conduct should be to safeguard the \\ninterests of investors and avoid unfair or fraudulent trade practices. The Code of Conduct \\nshould ensure that there is alignment of interests of investors, distributor as well as the \\nCategory III AIF issuing units, when offering distribution services to such fund. Hence, the \\nInternal Code of Conduct should ensure that there are no conflicts of interest, when \\ndistributing units on behalf of a Category III AIF and marketing the fund/scheme to potential \\ninvestors. \\n \\nModel Code of Conduct for Category III AIF Distributors142  \\ni. \\nAdhere to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, as amended \\nfrom time to time, and circulars issued by SEBI relating to distribution, marketing, \\n                                                          \\n \\n142 Model Code of Conduct for Category III AIF Distributors to be read along-with the Code of Conduct mentioned \\nin SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations. \\n328 | P a g e  \\n \\nperformance benchmarking and investor reporting requirements of Category III \\nAIFs. \\nii. \\nBe fully conversant with key provisions of PPM disclosures made by the Category \\nIII AIF, such as Investment Strategy, Fee Structure and key terms of the \\nContribution Agreement to be signed by an investor and the Category III AIF \\nmanager.  \\niii. \\nInform investors about the key risk factors of each fund/scheme and desist from \\nmisrepresentation or exaggeration. Encourage investors to go through the \\ndisclosures made in the PPM and all related documents of the fund/scheme before \\nmaking an investment decision. \\niv. \\nDisclose all material information including Hurdle Rate, Management Fees, \\nAdditional Returns and Catch-up provisions, if any, expenses chargeable to the \\nFund and expenses to be borne by the investment manager. \\nv. \\nConsider investor\\'s interest, risk profiling and suitability to their financial needs \\nwhile marketing Category III AIFs and advising on the same.  \\nvi. \\nHighlight all assumptions made by the Category III AIF in performance calculation, \\nrisk assessment and performance estimation, if any. \\nvii. \\nTake necessary steps to ensure that the investors’ interest is protected. Ensure \\nthat commissions or incentives on sale of Category III AIF units shall never form as \\nthe basis for recommending a fund/scheme. \\nviii. \\nDisclose all material information including the details of distribution commissions \\nto be received, on subscription to various classes of units offered by the Category \\nIII AIF.  \\nix. \\nAbstain from assuring returns in any Category III AIF fund/scheme and from any \\nkind of misrepresentation thereon. \\nx. \\nAbstain from attracting investors through unethical means such as providing an \\noffer of rebate, pass-back, gifts or other concessions.  \\nxi. \\nAbstain from obfuscating the decision-making process of investors, by omission of \\nmaterial facts or misleading investors about the fund/scheme.   \\nxii. \\nMaintain high standards of integrity, promptitude and fairness in the conduct of \\nbusiness as a Distributor. \\nxiii. \\nAct with required skill, care and diligence in the conduct of business as a \\nDistributor. \\nxiv. \\nAssist clients in completing KYC documentation and verification procedures. \\nxv. \\nMaintain necessary infrastructure to provide pre-commitment and post-\\ncommitment support to investors, investment manager, regulators and third-\\nparty service providers. This may include support in terms of providing intimations \\nfor draw-downs, capital calls, investor meetings, redemptions, fund-closing, \\ninvestor grievances, dispatching of performance reports to investors and other \\nimportant matters from time to time. \\n329 | P a g e  \\n \\nxvi. \\nStay updated with latest developments in the Category III AIF markets, changes in \\nthe Fund Sponsor, Investment Manager, changes in controlling interest of the \\nfund/scheme, exit of key executives, adverse developments and other material \\naspects. \\nxvii. \\nMaintain confidentiality of investors’ personal data, deals and transactions done \\nby a Category III AIF.  \\nxviii. \\nProvide relevant documents of investors to tax authorities and enforcement \\nagencies under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, including KYC \\ndocuments, Power of Attorney (PoA), and any other information as may be \\nrequired from time to time. \\nxix. \\nAbstain from making negative statements about other Category III AIFs that the \\ndistributor is not representing. Ensure that comparison of Category III AIFs is done \\nbetween similar and comparable Category III AIFs, based on adequate information. \\nxx. \\nNot indulge in any manipulative, fraudulent or deceptive practices or spread \\nrumours with a view to make personal gain.  \\n \\n10.4.1 Prohibit fraudulent and unfair trade practices \\n \\nDistributors of Category III AIFs have the responsibility to protect investors from potential \\nfraudulent activities. Unfair or fraudulent practices may be done by third-party service \\nproviders, when dealing with confidential data of investors in the fund/scheme. Direct or \\nindirect misleading statements, concealing or omitting material facts of the fund/scheme, \\nconcealing key risk factors of the fund/scheme and not taking reasonable care to ensure \\nsuitability of the fund/scheme to the investor will be construed as a fraudulent or unfair trade \\npractice. \\n \\nDistributors should take reasonable steps to ensure that their internal staff is assisting in the \\ndocumentation and KYC process, while on-boarding a new client or investor. This reduces the \\nrisk of potential fraudulent activities by third-party service providers, such as data theft, \\nmisuse of confidential data and sharing such data without seeking consent. They should be \\ndiligent in attesting investor documents and performing In-Person Verification (IPV) of \\ninvestors, for the KYC process. The Distributor should also ensure that their staff is following \\nthe Internal Code of Conduct, set within the firm, and communicating all the potential \\nviolations to the Compliance Officer or Operations Officer, in the Distributor’s office. \\n \\nDistributors should abstain from providing incorrect or misleading information of their \\nOrganization and employees, officials or sales agents to the investor. They should abstain \\nfrom tampering with investor details provided in the documentation. Distributors should also \\nensure that they are not in violation of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade \\nPractices relating to Securities Market) Regulations. \\n \\n330 | P a g e  \\n \\nCategory III AIFs can be ‘deemed to be connected persons’, as specified in the SEBI \\n(Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, and hence shall not communicate, provide or \\nallow access to unpublished price sensitive information, except in furtherance of business \\npurposes, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. Distributors should ensure \\nthat the Category III AIF is maintaining a structured digital database internally, to disclose \\nthe nature of unpublished price sensitive information shared, names of persons who have \\nshared such information and names of persons with whom such information is shared, along \\nwith the Permanent Account Number of the recipient. \\nDistributors should not follow unfair practices such as extending Pass-backs to investors, who \\nsubscribe to units of a Category III AIF being marketed by such distributor. Pass-backs are an \\nindirect incentive provided to potential investors, wherein the distributor gives back a part of \\nthe commission earned from the AIF, to the investor. This represents an inherent conflict \\nwherein potential investors are discouraged to take investment decisions based on the merit \\nof the fund and investment strategy implemented by the investment manager.  \\n \\n10.4.2 Prohibit conflict of interest \\n \\nDistributors should observe high standards of ethics, integrity and fairness in its dealings with \\nclients, inter-alia including Investors, Category III AIF and its investment manager, Custodians \\nand other third-party service providers such as law firms, due diligence experts etc. They \\nshould render high standards of service, exercise due diligence, and ensure proper care and \\ndesist from practices that would involve conflict of professional interest or put investor \\ninterests in jeopardy.  \\n \\nThe Distributors shall not market or sell products of a Category III AIF, wherein they have a \\npotential conflict of interest with such fund, investment manager, employees of the \\ninvestment manager, sponsor, trustee or a third-party service provider engaged by such fund. \\nA potential conflict of interest can be created if the Distributor is a relative, associate or an \\naffiliate or subsidiary of such fund, investment manager or sponsor, as per the SEBI \\n(Intermediaries) Regulations.  \\n \\nDistributors should also abstain from entering into Soft Dollar Arrangements with investment \\nmanagers. In a soft dollar arrangement, the Category III AIF may use clients’ money as a \\nmedium to pay for third-party research and proprietary research. Research should be \\npurchased with client assets, only if the primary use of such research report or service directly \\nassists the manager in investment decision-making process and not in the management of \\nthe investment firm. Any proprietary research should be paid for from the assets of the \\ninvestment manager.  \\n \\n331 | P a g e  \\n \\nSoft Dollar Arrangements can indirectly add to the cost of investment, which is indirectly \\nborne by the investors and is a potential conflict of interest. Investment Managers must \\nconsider the capabilities of brokers appointed by the Category III AIF, to provide Best \\nExecution for clients. Distributors should ensure that the investment manager acts as a \\nfiduciary and disclose all benefits which the investment manager receives through a client’s \\nbrokerage. Industry best practices require that Distributors should document the Soft Dollar \\nArrangements with Clients. The Investment Manager must disclose to the Client that the \\nCategory III AIF may engage in Soft Dollar Arrangements. \\n \\nDistributors should not follow unfair practices such as extending Pass-backs to investors, as \\nthis represents an inherent conflict. Further, the Category III AIF and the investment manager \\nshould also ensure that there are no potential conflicts of interest between the Distributor \\nand the investors. Distributors should avoid getting capital commitments from an entity \\nwhich is a subsidiary, associate or affiliate of the Distributor, or an entity in which such \\ndistributor is a director or holds more than 10% of the paid-up capital. Such conflicts of \\ninterest should be avoided, especially when there are investor side letters signed between \\nthe Category III AIF and entities investing in the fund, which are affiliates, subsidiaries or \\nassociates of the Distributor. This investment represents a ‘related party transaction’, liable \\nfor further scrutiny under the direct tax laws. \\n \\nDistributors should also ensure that they engage with such Category III AIFs which do not have \\npotential conflicts of interests at the fund level, or such potential conflicts are disclosed in the \\nPPM, by the investment manager. Distributors should ensure that material conflicts of \\ninterest are disclosed to all investors, before they make an investment decision. Investment \\nManagers should prepare research reports, make investment recommendations, and take \\ninvestment actions that always place the interests of the clients before the interests of the \\nCategory III AIF and its employees. The Investment Manager should have effective policies \\nand controls in the organization, to minimize conflicts of interest which may jeopardize the \\nindependence and objectivity of research. \\n \\n10.4.3 Prohibit marketing activities detrimental to investors and employees \\n \\nDistributors should observe high standards of transparency and ethics, when marketing a \\nfund/scheme of a Category III AIF. They should intimate the Category III AIF, investment \\nmanager, investors and SEBI about any changes in the distributor’s status, constitution, \\naddress, contact details or any other information provided at the time of obtaining AIF \\ndistributorship. Distributors should adhere to the guidelines and other statutory \\nrequirements, as may be prescribed from time to time, related to distributors, selling, \\ndistribution and marketing practices by industry associations. \\n \\n332 | P a g e  \\n \\nDistributors should ensure that their employees, sales team and agents follow the Internal \\nCode of Conduct, with respect to safeguarding the interests of investors. Employees should \\nnot try to mislead potential investors, in order to secure their compensation. They should \\nconsider investor\\'s interest and risk profiling before pitching any Category III AIF schemes. \\n \\nWhen providing their distribution services, Distributors should abstain from assuring returns \\nto the investors, in any Category III AIF fund/scheme. They should be conversant with key \\nprovisions of PPM disclosures made by the Category III AIF, such as Investment Strategy, Fee \\nStructure and key terms of the Contribution Agreement to be signed by an investor and the \\nCategory III AIF investment manager. The Distribution Kit should be updated on a regular basis \\nwith necessary information and FAQs for the investors. Further, distributors should inform \\ninvestors about the key risk factors of each fund/scheme and encourage investors to read the \\nPPM and other scheme-related documents. \\n \\nDistributors should ensure that they maintain confidentiality of investors’ personal data, deals \\nand transactions done by a Category III AIF. Distributors should abstain from influencing the \\ndecision-making process of investors, by omitting material facts or misleading investors about \\nthe fund/scheme. They should not extend Pass-backs to investors or enter into soft-dollar \\narrangements with Category III AIFs. Distributors should disclose details of distribution \\ncommissions to be received, on subscription to various classes of units offered by the \\nCategory III AIF. Similarly, distributors should abstain from making negative statements about \\nother Category III AIFs and provide comparison of Category III AIFs, with similar fund \\ncharacteristics. \\n10.5 Importance of Insurance for a Category III AIF \\n \\nA Category III AIF is a pooled investment vehicle which invests funds in various asset classes, \\nbased on the Investment Strategy of the fund. The investment manager has a fiduciary \\nresponsibility to safeguard the funds and generate the expected returns for all classes of \\ninvestors in the fund. However, the investment manager faces market risk, wherein the \\nmanager would not be able to ascertain certain factors influencing price movements in the \\nsecurities market. This may be due to uncontrollable factors, specific to the country in which \\nthe fund is domiciled, or due to global macro-economic factors and social factors impacting \\nthe performance of the securities markets, at a large scale.  \\n \\nInvestors in the fund indirectly face the market risk and risk of uncertainty in the prices of \\nsecurities. If investors may not receive the expected returns due to the inefficiency or errors \\non behalf of the investment manager, they may file a legal suit against such Category III AIF, \\nas per the clauses in the Contribution Agreement. In order to prevent such legal suits and the \\ncosts associated with such legal actions, the Category III AIF should purchase a ‘Professional \\nIndemnity Insurance’. Professional Indemnity Insurance protects the Category III AIF from any \\n333 | P a g e  \\n \\ncosts borne by such fund, as a result of a substantial loss caused to an investor due to errors \\nand omissions in the services provided to such investor. Hence, the insurance policy is also \\nknown an ‘E&O Insurance’ or ‘Errors and Omissions Insurance’ taken by the Category III AIF \\nto safeguard against any potential losses to investors, on account of an error or omission by \\nthe investment manager and the investment management team. It is to be noted that such \\ninsurance policy safeguards the Category III AIF, which has bought the insurance policy, \\nagainst potential losses to investors. \\n \\nDirectors, partners and executives of the entity managing the fund, such as the Fund Sponsor \\nand the Investment Manager, can also purchase ‘D&O Liability Insurance’. Such insurance is \\nintended to safeguard key individuals from personal losses, if they are sued as a result of \\nserving as a director or an officer of a Category III AIF. ‘D&O Insurance’ claims can cover losses \\nassociated with any lawsuit filed against the directors and officers, including legal fees. \\nHowever, such insurance policies do not cover claims on account of fraudulent activities of \\nthe directors and officers of the Category III AIF. \\n \\nThe Investment Manager is the key decision-maker for a Category III AIF, making investment \\ndecisions on behalf of the investors in the fund. Successful investment funds rely heavily on \\nthe intellect and expertise of key personnel in the fund, making investment decisions. An \\nunexpected loss of key personnel, or key-man, of the Category III AIF is a significant risk to \\ninvestors, especially if such fund is relying on a single investment manager. ‘Key-man \\nInsurance’ is taken by a Category III AIF to compensate the fund for financial losses arising \\nfrom the death or incapacity of a key executive, such as the investment manager. The \\nInsurance can cover events such as ‘death’, ‘incapacity’, ‘kidnap’ or ‘disability’ of a key \\nexecutive, which can significantly impact the decision-making capacity of such key executive \\nand hence, the potential returns of the fund. Purchasing key-man insurance can give investors \\na comfort that the Category III AIF will be able to make orderly dissolution, in case of \\nimmediate liquidation or transition of the fund, wherein a new investment manager is \\nappointed as part of Succession Planning. Hence, investors can be assured that they will be \\ncompensated for setbacks incurred from the loss of the key-person’s services. \\n \\nKey-man Insurance and Professional Indemnity Insurance, such as ‘E&O Insurance’ and ‘D&O \\nLiability Insurance’ are important for a Category III AIF to contain losses incurred by the fund, \\nkey personnel of the fund as well as the investors, due to unpredictable factors. Distributors \\nengaging with Category III AIFs should ascertain the risks borne by Category III AIFs, due to \\npotential losses to investors and suggest funds to buy such insurance policies. However, the \\ncost of the insurance premium is indirectly borne by the investors in the Category III AIF. The \\namount of insurance taken is typically around 1-2% of the total assets under management \\nand covers all the entities in the Category III AIF, including the trust, fund scheme, investment \\nmanager, sponsor and settlor. \\n \\n \\n334 | P a g e  \\n \\nChapter 10: Sample Questions \\n \\n1.

The \\nInstitute was established in pursuant to the Union Finance Minister’s proposal, in his 2005-06 \\nBudget Speech, to set up an institution ‘for teaching and training intermediaries in the \\nsecurities markets and promoting research’. \\nNISM is committed to its vision ‘to lead, catalyze and deliver educational initiatives to enhance \\nthe quality of securities markets’. The Institute conducts a wide range of capacity building \\nprogrammes in securities markets - from basic ﬁnancial literacy to full-time post-graduation\\nprogrammes. The Institute’s six Schools of Excellence, viz., School for Certiﬁcation of \\nIntermediaries, School for Securities Education, School for Investor Education and Financial \\nLiteracy, School for Regulatory Studies and Supervision, School for Corporate Governance \\nand School for Securities Information and Research upholds NISM’s vision and works in \\nsynergy towards professionalizing the markets.\\nNISM is mandated by SEBI (Certiﬁcation of Associated Persons in the Securities Markets) \\nRegulations, 2007 to conduct certiﬁcation examinations and continuing professional \\neducation programs for associated persons engaged by an intermediary. NISM also conducts \\ncertiﬁcation examinations for other regulators like IBBI and PFRDA. NISM’s certiﬁcations \\nestablish a single market-wide knowledge benchmark for different functions in the Indian \\nsecurities market and enable the associated persons to advance their knowledge and skills.\\nwww.nism.ac.in\\nNISM Campus\\nPlot No. IS 1 & 2, Patalganga Industrial Area,\\nMohopada, District Raigad,\\nMaharashtra–410222\\nTel: +91-2192-668300/01\\nNISM Bhavan\\nPlot No. 82, Sector–17,\\nVashi, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra–400703 \\nTel: +91-22-66735100/5101\\nFax: 022-66735110\\nNISM Registered Office\\n5th floor, NCL Cooperative Society,\\nPlot No. C-6, E-Block, Bandra Kurla Complex,\\nBandra East, Mumbai, 400051\\nTel: +91-22-41738811\\nNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SECURITIES MARKETS\\n\"\\n    MERGE (node1)-[:is_parent_of]->(node2)\\n    RETURN node1, node2\\n    '"
